Classification of states Exercises [6.1.10]-[6.2.5]

(a) Xm+r forr > 0.
(b) X, for m = 0.
(c) The sequence of pairs (Xp, Xn41) forn > 0.

10. Let X be a Markov chain. Show that, for 1 <r <n,

P(X, =k | X; =x; fori =1,2,...,r-—1,r+1...,n)
= P(X, =k | Xp_-1 = Xp-1, Xp = Ar 41)-

11. Let {X, : n > 1} be independent identically distributed integer-valued random variables. Let
Sp = OP Xr, with So = 0, Yn = Xn + Xp—1 with Xp = 0, and Zy = D-_o S;. Which of the
following constitute Markov chains: (a) Sp, (b) Yn, (¢) Zn, (d) the sequence of pairs (Sy, Zn)?

12. Astochastic matrix P is called doubly stochastic if 7; pij = 1 forall j. Itis called sub-stochastic
if 7; pi ij <1 for all j. Show that, if P is stochastic (respectively, doubly stochastic, sub-stochastic),
then P” is stochastic (respectively, doubly stochastic, sub-stochastic) for all n.

6.2 Exercises. Classification of states

1. Last exits, Let Jj;(2) = P(Xn = j, X_ # ifor1 < k <n | Xo =i), the probability that the
chain passes from i to j in n steps without revisiting i. Writing

Li(s) = >> sli),
n=1

show that P;;(s) = Pi (s)Lij(s) if i # j. Deduce that the first passage times and last exit times
have the same distribution for any Markov chain for which Pjj(s) = P;;(s) for all i and 7. Give an
example of such a chain.

2. Let X bea Markov chain containing an absorbing state s with which all other states i communicate,
in the sense that p;;(n) > 0 for some n = n(i). Show that all states other than s are transient.

3. Show that a state i is persistent if and only if the mean number of visits of the chain to 7, having
started at i, is infinite.

4. Visits. Let V; = |{n => 1: Xn = j}| be the number of visits of the Markov chain X to j, and
define nj; = P(V; = 00 | Xp =i). Show that:
1 ifi is persistent,
ans =
@) i { 0. if is transient,
P(T; <co| Xo =i) if j is persistent,
(b) nj = pas .
0 if j is transient,

5. Symmetry. The distinct pair i, j of states of a Markov chain is called symmetric if

where 7; = min{n > 1: X_ = j}.

PT) <T | Xo =) =P < T | X0= J),

where 7; = min{n > 1: X, =i}. Show that, if Xo =i andi, j is symmetric, the expected number
of visits to j before the chain revisits i is 1.
