1. If X(@) is an irreducible persistent non-null Markov chain, and u(-) is a bounded function on the
integers, show that

1 t
-f u(X(s)) ds = S~ nul),
F JO ieS

where z is the stationary distribution of X(t).

2. Let M(t) be an alternating renewal process, with interarrival pairs {X,, Y, : r > 1}. Show that

1 EX,

3. Let C(s) be the current lifetime (or age) of a renewal process N(t) with a typical interarrival time
X. Show that

1 ft E(x?

Find the corresponding limit for the excess lifetime.

4. Let j and k be distinct states of an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain X with stationary
distribution 2. Show that

where 7; = min{n > 1: X, = i} is the first passage time to the state i. [Hint: Consider the times of
return to j having made an intermediate visit to k.]

4. Find the asymptotic distribution of the current life C(t) of N ast + oo when X is not arithmetic.

5. Let N bea Poisson process with intensity A. Show that the total life D(¢) at time t has distribution
function P(D(t) < x) = 1—(1+Amin{t, x})e~** for x > 0. Deduce that E(D(t)) = (2—e7*4)//a.
