forn > |. Also
5(cos(mU) cos(nU)) = Ef 3 (cos[(m + n)U] + cosl(m — n)U])} = 0

ifm #n. Hence X is stationary with autocorrelation function p(k) = dz0, and spectral density
function f(A) = (27)! for |A| < 2. Finally

E{cos(mU) cos(nU) cos(rU)} = SEY (cos{(m +n)U] + cos[(m — n)U]) cos(ru)}
= 4{o(m+n—-r)+p(m—n—r)}

which takes different values in the two cases (m,n, r) = (1, 2,3), (2, 3,4).

6. (a) The increments of N during any collection of intervals {(u;, vj) : 1 <i <n} have the same
fdds if all the intervals are shifted by the same constant. Therefore X is strongly stationary. Certainly
E(X (f)) = Aa for all t, and the autocovariance function is

0 if ’

Therefore the autocorrelation function is

0 if |t| > a,
p= .
1—|t/o| if |t] <a,

which we recognize as the characteristic function of the spectral density f(A) = {1—cos(a@A)}/ (a2);
see Problems (5.12.27b, 28a).

(b) We have that E(X(t)) = 0; furthermore, for s < t, the correlation of X(s) and X(t) is

e0v(X6), X(t) = cov W(s) — Ws - 1), Wt) — We - 1))
=s-—min{fs,t-1}-(-l+6-1)
1 ifs <t-1,
ae ift-l<s<t.

This depends on t — s only, and therefore X is stationary; X is Gaussian and therefore strongly
stationary also.
The autocorrelation function is

0 if |h| > 1,

h) =
pth) oat if |h| <1,

which we recognize as the characteristic function of the density function f(A) = (1 — cosa)/ (2).

7. We have from Problem (8.7.1) that the general moving-average process of part (b) is stationary
with autocovariance function c(k) = j=0 oj c.4;,k = O, with the convention that as = Oif s < 0
ors >r.

(a) In this case, the autocorrelation function is

1 ifk =0,
a
pk) 1+ a if |k|
0 if |k] > 1,
