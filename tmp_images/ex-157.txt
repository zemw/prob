[1.8.28]-[1.8.33] Solutions Events and their probabilities

Eddington himself thought the answer to be rae hence the ‘controversy’. He argued that a truthful
denial leaves things unresolved, so that if, for example, B truthfully denies that C contradicts D, then
we cannot deduce that C supports D. He deduced that the only sequences which are inconsistent with
the given statement are AB°CD and AB°C°D*, and therefore

so at least 20 per cent of such cubes have only red vertices.

29. (a) P(B | A) = P(AN B)/P(A) = P(A | B)P(B)/P(A) > P(B).

(b) P(A | BS) = P(AN B°)/P(B°) = {P(A) — P(AN B)}/P(BS) < P(A).

(c) No. Consider the case ANC = @.

30. The number of possible combinations of birthdays of m people is 365”; the number of combina-
tions of different birthdays is 365!/(365 — m)!. Use your calculator for the final part.
