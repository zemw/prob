Birth processes and the Poisson process Solutions - [6.8.2]-[6.8.4]

where C = {two or more flies arrive in (¢, f + h]} and D = {two or more wasps arrive in (t, t + h]}.
This probability is no greater than (Ah)(uh) + o(h) = ofA).

2. Let I be the incoming Poisson process, and let G be the process of arrivals of green insects.
Matters of independence are dealt with as above. Finally,

P(G(t +h) =n+1|GQ@ =n) = pP(IG +h) =n 4+1| I(t) =n) + 04) = pah + Off),
P(G(t +h) >n+1|GQ@) =n) < PU +h) > n4+1/1@ =n) =o(h).

3. Conditioning on 7; and using the time-homogeneity of the process,

P(Et-—u)>x) ifus<t,
P(E(@) > x|Tj =u) = 0 ift<u<t4+x,
1 ifu>t+x,

(draw a diagram to help you see this). Therefore

You may solve the integral equation using Laplace transforms. Alternately you may guess the
answer and then check that it works. The answer is P(E(t) < x) = 1 — e~*, the exponential
distribution. Actually this answer is obvious since E(t) > x if and only if there is no arrival in
[t, t +x], an event having probability e~**.

4. The forward equation is

with boundary conditions p;;(0) = 6;;, the Kronecker delta. We write G;(s,t) = 0 i si pij (t), the
probability generating function of B(¢) conditional on B(Q) = i. Multiply through the differential
equation by s/ and sum over j:

a partial differential equation with boundary condition G;(s, 0) = s’. This may be solved in the usual
way to obtain G;(s, t) = ete d- s7)) for some function g. Using the boundary condition, we
find that g(1 — s~!) = 5! and so g(u) = (1 —u)~, yielding
