[12.9.3]-[12.9.8] Exercises Martingales

times B; < By <--- < By; his family may be described by the vector (N, By, Bo,..., By). Each
subsequent member x of the population has a family described similarly by a vector (N(x), By(x),...,
By x) @)) having the same distribution as (N, B,,..., By) and independent of all other individuals’
families. The number N(x) is the number of his offspring, and B;(x) is the time between the births
of the parent and the ith offspring. Let {B,,, : r > 1} be the times of births of individuals in the nth
generation. Let M, (0) = >>, e~98x,r, and show that Y, = My (0)/E(M,(@))" defines a martingale
with respect to Fy, = o ({Bm,r :m <n, r >= 1)), for any value of @ such that EM (0) < o.

3. Let (Y, F) be a martingale with EY, = 0 and E(Y2) < o¢ for all n. Show that

x > 0.

4. Let (Y, £) beanon-negative submartingale with Yp = 0, and let {c,} be a non-increasing sequence
of positive numbers. Show that

Such an inequality is sometimes named after subsets of Hajek, Rényi, and Chow. Deduce Kol-
mogorov’s inequality for the sum of independent random variables. [Hint: Work with the martingale
Zn = Cnn — Dipat CKE(X« | Fe—1) + has (Ce-1 — ce) Ye—1 where Xy = Ye — Ye-1.]

5. Suppose that the sequence {X,, : n > 1} of random variables satisfies E(Xy | X1, X2,..., Xn—-1)
= 0 for all n, and also S772, E(Xxl")/k" < 00 for some r € [1,2]. Let Sy = 577.) Z; where
Z; = X;/i, and show that

Deduce that S, converges a.s. as n — oo, and hence that nol yi Xe 25 0. [Hint: In the case
1 <r < 2, prove and use the fact that h(u) = |u|" satisfies h(v)—h(u) < (v—u)h’(u)+2h((v—u)/2).
Kronecker’s lemma is useful for the last part.]

6. Let X1, X2,... be independent random variables with

1 with probability (2n)—},
Xn = 0 with probability 1—n7!,
—1 with probability (2n)~!.

Let Y; = X, and forn > 2

{ Xn if Y,-; = 9,

a= :

nY,—1|Xn| if Yn_-1 #0.

Show that Y;, is a martingale with respect to F, = 0(¥1, Yo,..., Yn). Show that Y, does not converge

almost surely. Does Y, converge in any way? Why does the martingale convergence theorem not
apply?

7. Let X1, X2,... be independent identically distributed random variables and suppose that M(t) =
E(e’*1) satisfies M(t) = 1 for some t > 0. Show that P(S; > x for some k) < e~* for x > 0 and
such a value of t, where Sy = Xj + Xo+---+ Xx.

8. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation of a branching process with family-size probability
generating function G(s), and assume Zo = 1. Let & be the smallest positive root of G(s) = s.
