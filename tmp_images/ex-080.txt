6.8 Exercises. Birth processes and the Poisson process

1. Superposition. Flies and wasps land on your dinner plate in the manner of independent Poisson
processes with respective intensities A and yz. Show that the arrivals of flying objects form a Poisson
process with intensity A + je.

2. Thinning. Insects land in the soup in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity 4, and each
such insect is green with probability p, independently of the colours of all other insects. Show that
the arrivals of green insects form a Poisson process with intensity Ap.

3. Let T,, be the time of the nth arrival in a Poisson process N with intensity A, and define the excess
lifetime process E(t) = Tyit)41 — t, being the time one must wait subsequent to t before the next
arrival. Show by conditioning on 7 that

Solve this integral equation in order to find the distribution function of E(t). Explain your conclusion.

4. Let B bea simple birth process (6.8.11b) with B(O) = /; the birth rates are A, = nA. Write
down the forward system of equations for the process and deduce that

P(B(t) =k) = ( : ier eel gay,

Show also that E(B(t)) = Te! and var(B(t)) = Te24f(1 — e*).

5. Let B be a process of simple birth with immigration (6.8.11c) with parameters 4 and v, and
with B(O) = 0; the birth rates are A, = nA + v. Write down the sequence of differential—-difference
equations for py (t) = P(B(t) = n). Without solving these equations, use them to show that m(t) =
E(B(t)) satisfies m!(t) = Am(t) + v, and solve for m(t).

6. Let N be a birth process with intensities 49,41,..., and let N(O) = 0. Show that p,(t) =

7. Suppose that the general birth process of the previous exercise is such that a An 1 < 00.
Show that A, pn(t) > f(t) as n — oo where f is the density function of the random variable
