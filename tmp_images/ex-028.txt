Dependence Exercises [3.4.9]-[3.6.5]

9. Matching. (a) Use the inclusion—exclusion formula (3.4.2) to derive the result of Example
(3.4.3), namely: in a random permutation of the first » integers, the probability that exactly r retain

their original positions is
1 (5 1 feed (-1)"*
ri\2! 3! (n—r)t J

(b) Let dy, be the number of derangements of the first n integers (that is, rearrangements with no
integers in their original positions). Show that d,41 = ndn +nd,_, forn > 2. Deduce the result of
part (a).

3.5 Exercises. Examples of discrete variables

1. De Moivre trials. Each trial may result in any of ¢ given outcomes, the ith outcome having
probability p;. Let Nj; be the number of occurrences of the ith outcome in n independent trials. Show

that
n!

P(N; = nj for 1 <i <t) = ————— p'! py? -- py"
nying!---ny!
for any collection 11,2, ...,n; of non-negative integers with sum n. The vector N is said to have

the multinomial distribution.

2. In your pocket is a random number N of coins, where N has the Poisson distribution with
parameter A. You toss each coin once, with heads showing with probability p each time. Show that
the total number of heads has the Poisson distribution with parameter Ap.

3. Let X be Poisson distributed where P(X = 2) = pa(A) = Ate /n! for n > 0. Show that
P(X <n) =1- fo Pn (x) dx.

4. Capture-recapture. A population of b animals has had a number a of its members captured,

marked, and released. Let X be the number of animals it is necessary to recapture (without re-release)
in order to obtain m marked animals. Show that

vam 5 (roa) / (2)

and find EX. This distribution has been called negative hypergeometric.

3.6 Exercises. Dependence
1, Show that the collection of random variables on a given probability space and having finite
variance forms a vector space over the reals.
2. Find the marginal mass functions of the multinomial distribution of Exercise (3.5.1).
3. Let X and Y be discrete random variables with joint mass function

ty-)atyatyt+l’

f@.y)= x,y =1,2,3,....

Find the marginal mass functions of X and Y, calculate C, and also the covariance of X and Y.

4. Let X and Y be discrete random variables with mean 0, variance 1, and covariance p. Show that
E(max{X?, ¥7}) <14+ V1 — p?.
