[3.3.4]-[3.4.1] Solutions Discrete random variables

4. The expected reward is 77°, 2-*.2k = oo. If your utility function is w, then your ‘fair’ entrance
fee is we 2-ky (2k). For example, if u(k) = c(1 — k~®) for k => 1, where c, a > O, then the fair

fee is
k k 1
_ ok, _ _
oD? d-2 )=e(1 az):

This fee is certainly not ‘fair’ for the person offering the wager, unless possibly he is a noted philan-
thropist.

5. We have that E(X%) = S792, x®/{x(x + 1)}, which is finite if and only if a < 1.
6. Clearly )

var(a + X) = E({(a +X) —E(a + X)}”) = E({X — E(X)}*) = var(X).

7. For each r, bet {1 + a(r)}—! on horse r. If the rth horse wins, your payoff is {z(r) + 1}{1+
x(r)}~! = 1, which is in excess of your total stake 37, {1 (k) + 1}7!.

8. We may assume that: (a) after any given roll of the die, your decision whether or not to stop
depends only on the value V of the current roll; (b) if it is optimal to stop for V = r, then it is also
optimal to stop when V > r.

Consider the strategy: stop the first time that the die shows r or greater. Let S(r) be the expected
score achieved by following this stategy. By elementary calculations,

S(6) = 6- P(6 appears before 1) + 1 - P(1 appears before 6) = 5,

and similarly $(5) = 4, S(4) = 4, 53) = 2, S(2) = 4. The optimal strategy is therefore to stop at
the first throw showing 4, 5, or 6. Similar arguments may be used to show that ‘stop at 5 or 6’ is the
rule to maximize the expected squared score.

9. Proceeding as in Exercise (8), we find the expected returns for the same strategies to be:
S@)=4-3c, S(6)=4-2c, S(4)=4-3e, SBV=P-$c, S2=F-c.

Ifc= 7 it is best to stop when the score is at least 4; if c = 1, you should stop when the score is at
least 3. The respective expected scores are ui and 13.

1. Let J; be the indicator function of the event that the outcome of the (j + 1)th toss is different from
the outcome of the jth toss. The number R of distinct runs is given by R = 1+ a I;, Hence
