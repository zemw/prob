[11.3.1]-[11.4.1] Solutions Queues

11.3 Solutions. M/G/1

1. In equilibrium, the queue-length Q,, just after the nth departure satisfies

(*) On+1 = An + On — h(Qn)

where A, is the number of arrivals during the (7 + 1)th service period, and h(@m) = 1 — 3y9.-Now
Qn and Qy+) have the same distribution. Take expectations to obtain

(**) 0 = E(An) — P(Qn > 9),

where E(A,,) = Ad, the mean number of arrivals in an interval of length d. Next, square () and take
expectations:

0 = E(Az) + E((Qn)*) + 2{E(An On) — E(Ank(Qn)) —E(Qnk(Qn)) }.
Use the facts that Ay is independent of Q,, and that Q,4(Qn) = Qn, to find that

0 = {(ad)* + Ad} + P(Qn > 0) + 2{ (Ad — 1)E(Qn) — AdP(Qn > 0)}

and therefore, by («*«),

2p — p?

2(1 — p)”

2. From the standard theory, Mg satisfies Mg(s) = Ms(s — A +AMp(s)), where Ms(0) =

L/(u — 9). Substitute to find that x = Mg(s) is a root of the quadratic Ax? — xAtpu—s)+pu=0.
For some small positive s, Mz(s) is smooth and non-decreasing. Therefore Mp (s) is the root given.

E(Qn) =

3. Let T, be the instant of time at which the server is freed for the nth time. By the lack-of-memory
property of the exponential distribution, the time of the first arrival after 7, is independent of all
arrivals prior to T,, whence Ty is a ‘regeneration point’ of the queue (so to say). It follows that the
times which elapse between such regeneration points are independent, and it is easily seen that they
have the same distribution.

1. The transition matrix of the imbedded chain obtained by observing queue-lengths just before
arrivals is

The equation x = 2P,4 may be written as
0° i foe)
m= om(1- oa). Tn = > QT n4i-1 forn > 1.

i=0 j=0 i=0

It is easily seen, by adding, that the first equation is a consequence of the remaining equations, taken
in conjunction with i nm; = 1. Therefore m is specified by the equation for z,,n > 1.
