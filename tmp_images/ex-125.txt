8. Consider a G/G/1 queue in which the service times are constantly equal to 2, whilst the interarrival
times take either of the values 1 and 4 with equal probability 5 Find the limiting waiting time
distribution.

9. Consider an extremely idealized model of a telephone exchange having infinitely many channels
available. Calls arrive in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity 4, and each requires one
channel for a length of time having the exponential distribution with parameter jz, independently of
the arrival process and of the duration of other calls. Let Q(7) be the number of calls being handled
at time f, and suppose that Q(0) = [.

Determine the probability generating function of Q(t), and deduce E(Q(t)), P(Q(t) = 0), and
the limiting distribution of Q(t) as t > oc.

Assuming the queue is in equilibrium, find the proportion of time that no channels are occupied,
and the mean length of an idle period. Deduce that the mean length of a busy period is (e4/# — 1) /d.

10. Customers arrive in a shop in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity A, where 0 < A < 1.
They are served one by one in the order of their arrival, and each requires a service time of unit length.
Let Q(t) be the number in the queue at time t. By comparing Q(t) with Q(t + 1), determine the
limiting distribution of Q(t) as t — oo (you may assume that the quantities in question converge).
Hence show that the mean queue length in equilibrium is A(1 — 2) /(A—-A).

Let W be the waiting time of a newly arrived customer when the queue is in equilibrium. Deduce
from the results above that E(W) = 40/0 — ).

11. Consider M(A)/D(1)/1, and suppose that the queue is empty at time 0. Let T be the earliest time

at which a customer departs leaving the queue empty. Show that the moment generating function Mr
of T satisfies

s
log (1—~) + log Mr(s) = (s -4)(1- Mr(s)),
and deduce the mean value of 7, distinguishing between the cases A < 1 andA > 1.

12. Suppose A < ys, and consider a M(A)/M(jz)/1 queue Q in equilibrium.

(a) Show that Q is a reversible Markov chain.

(b) Deduce the equilibrium distributions of queue length and waiting time.

(c) Show that the times of departures of customers form a Poisson process, and that Q(f) is indepen-
dent of the times of departures prior to f.

(d) Consider a sequence of K single-server queues such that customers arrive at the first in the manner
of a Poisson process, and (for each j) on completing service in the jth queue each customer moves
to the (j + 1th. Service times in the jth queue are exponentially distributed with parameter j2;,
with as much independence as usual. Determine the (joint) equilibrium distribution of the queue
lengths, when A < j4; for all j.

13. Consider the queue M(A)/M(j)/k, where k > 1. Show that a stationary distribution 7 exists if
and only if A < ky, and calculate it in this case.
Suppose that the cost of operating this system in equilibrium is

n=k

the positive constants A and B representing respectively the costs of employing a server and of the
dissatisfaction of delayed customers.

Show that, for fixed jz, there is a unique value A* in the interval (0, jz) such that it is cheaper to
have k = 1 than k = 2 if and only if A < A*.

14. Customers arrive in a shop in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity 4. They form a
single queue. There are two servers, labelled 1 and 2, server i requiring an exponentially distributed
