[6.15.50]-[6.15.51] Exercises Markov chains

50. Events occur at the times of a Poisson process with intensity 4, and you are offered a bet based
on the process. Let t > 0. You are required to say the word ‘now’ immediately after the event which
you think will be the last to occur prior to time t. You win if you succeed, otherwise you lose. If no
events occur before t you lose. If you have not selected an event before time ¢ you lose.

Consider the strategy in which you choose the first event to occur after a specified time s, where
O<s <t.
(a) Calculate an expression for the probability that you win using this strategy.
(b) Which value of s maximizes this probability?
(c) If At > 1, show that the probability that you win using this value of s is el,

51. Anew Oxbridge professor wishes to buy a house, and can afford to spend up to one million pounds.
Declining the services of conventional estate agents, she consults her favourite internet property page
on which houses are announced at the times of a Poisson process with intensity 2 per day. House
prices may be assumed to be independent random variables which are uniformly distributed over the
interval (800,000, 2,000,000). She decides to view every affordable property announced during the
next 30 days. The time spent viewing any given property is uniformly distributed over the range (1, 2)
hours. What is the moment generating function of the total time spent viewing houses?
