Gaussian processes Exercises [9.4.3]-[9.6.2]

Show that ..., ¥_1, Yo, Y1,... is a sequence of uncorrelated random variables with zero means and
unit variances.

Show that X, may be represented as a moving average Xp = je—o0 aj;Y,—; where the a; are
constants satisfying

J2nf a) = = aj we th for A € (—1, 7].

3. Gaussian process. Let X be a discrete-time stationary sequence with zero mean and unit vari-
ance, and whose fdds are of the multivariate-normal type. Show that the spectral process of X has
independent increments having normal distributions.

9.6 Exercises. Gaussian processes

1. Show that the function c(s, t) = min{s, t} is positive definite. That is, show that

n

non-zero.
2. Let X,, X,... be a stationary Gaussian sequence with zero means and unit variances which

satisfies the Markov property. Find the spectral density function of the sequence in terms of the
constant p = cov(X, X2).
