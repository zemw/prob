(b) Show that if H(s) is the probability generating function of some infinitely divisible distribution
on the non-negative integers then H(s) = exp{—A + AG(s)} for some A (> 0) and some probability
generating function G(s).

14. The distribution of a random variable X is called infinitely divisible if, for all positive integers n,

” ys... YK”

there exists a sequence Y t of independent identically distributed random variables

such that X and yi” + yi” +...4¥ have the same distribution.

(a) Show that the normal, Poisson, and gamma distributions are infinitely divisible.

(b) Show that the characteristic function ¢ of an infinitely divisible distribution has no real zeros, in
that @(t) ¥ 0 for all real t.

15. Let X,, X2,... be independent variables each taking the values 0 or 1 with probabilities 1— p and
Pp, where 0 < p < 1. Let N be a random variable taking values in the positive integers, independent
of the X;, and write S = X, + Xo. +---+ Xy. Write down the conditional generating function of N
given that § = N, in terms of the probability generating function G of N. Show that N has a Poisson
distribution if and only if EQN \P = EQN | S = N) forall pand x.

16. If X and Y have joint probability generating function

Cx.) = EST) = et py

where p, + p2 < 1,

find the marginal mass functions of X and Y, and the mass function of X + Y. Find also the conditional
probability generating function G x\y(s | y) = E(s* | ¥ = y) of X given that Y = y. The pair X,Y
is said to have the bivariate negative binomial distribution.

17. If X and Y have joint probability generating function
Gx,y(s,t) = exp{a(s —) + 6@-D+yv6r—-D}

find the marginal distributions of X, Y, and the distribution of X + Y, showing that X and Y have the
Poisson distribution, but that X + Y does not unless y = 0.

(e) If X has density function (20x37) Ze—!/2) for x > O, then X has moment generating function
given by E(e'*) = exp{—V2r}, t > 0. [Note that E(X") = co forn > 1.]

19. Let X, Y, Z be independent N(0, 1) variables. Use characteristic functions and moment gener-
ating functions (Laplace transforms) to find the distributions of
