let Fp = o({ Rg, By 2 0 < k < n}). Show that Y, = R,/(Rn + By) defines a martingale. Suppose
Ro = Bo = 1, let T be the number of balls drawn until the first blue ball appears, and show that

15. Labouchere system. Here is a gambling system for playing a fair game. Choose a sequence
X1,%2,-..,X» Of positive numbers.

Wager the sum of the first and last numbers on an evens bet. If you win, delete those two numbers;
if you lose, append their sum as an extra term x,41 (= x1 + x») at the right-hand end of the sequence.

You play iteratively according to the above rule. If the sequence ever contains one term only, you
wager that amount on an evens bet. If you win, you delete the term, and if you lose you append it to
the sequence to obtain two terms.

Show that, with probability 1, the game terminates with a profit of }77 x;, and that the time until
termination has finite mean.

This looks like another clever strategy. Show that the mean size of your largest stake before
winning is infinite. (When Henry Labouchere was sent down from Trinity College, Cambridge, in
1852, his gambling debts exceeded £6000.)

16. Here is a martingale approach to the question of determining the mean number of tosses of a coin
before the first appearance of the sequence HHH. A large casino contains infinitely many gamblers
G , Go,..., each with an initial fortune of $1. A croupier tosses a coin repeatedly. For each n,
gambler G,, bets as follows. Just before the mth toss he stakes his $1 on the event that the nth toss
shows heads. The game is assumed fair, so that he receives a total of $ po if he wins, where p is the
probability of heads. If he wins this gamble, then he repeatedly stakes his entire current fortune on
heads, at the same odds as his first gamble. At the first subsequent tail he loses his fortune and leaves
the casino, penniless. Let S, be the casino’s profit (losses count negative) after the nth toss. Show
that S,, is a martingale. Let N be the number of tosses before the first appearance of HHH; show that
N is a stopping time and hence find E(N).

Now adapt this scheme to calculate the mean time to the first appearance of the sequence HTH.

17. Let {(Xx, Yx) : k = 1} be a sequence of independent identically distributed random vectors such
that each X, and Y; takes values in the set {—1,0, 1,2,...}. Suppose that E(X,) = E(¥j) = 0
and E(X,¥,) = c, and furthermore X, and Y, have finite non-zero variances. Let Ug and Vo
be positive integers, and define (Un41, Va41) = (Un. Vn) + (Xn41, Yn41) for each > 0. Let
T = min{n : UnVp_ = 0} be the first hitting time by the random walk (Un, Vn) of the axes of R?.
Show that E(T) < oo if and only if c < 0, and that E(T) = —E(UgVo)/c in this case. [Hint: You
might show that U,V, — cn is a martingale.]

18. The game ‘Red Now’ may be played by a single player with a well shuffled conventional pack of
52 playing cards. At times m = 1,2, ...,52 the player turns over a new card and observes its colour.
Just once in the game he must say, just before exposing a card, “Red Now”. He wins the game if the
next exposed card is red. Let R, be the number of red cards remaining face down after the nth card
has been turned over. Show that X, = R,/(52 —n),0 <n < 52, defines a martingale. Show that
there is no strategy for the player which results in a probability of winning different from 7.

19. A businessman has a redundant piece of equipment which he advertises for sale, inviting “offers
over £1000”. He anticipates that, each week for the foreseeable future, he will be approached by
one prospective purchaser, the offers made in week 0,1,... being £1000Xo, £1000X1,..., where
Xo, X1,... are independent random variables with a common density function f and finite mean.
Storage of the equipment costs £1000c per week and the prevailing rate of interest is w (> 0) per
