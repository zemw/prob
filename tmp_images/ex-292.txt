Stationary distributions and the limit theorem Solutions [6.4.4]-[6.4.5]

The final equation is a consequence of the previous ones, since a O x; = 1. Suppose then that
v = (1, v2, ...) is an infinite vector satisfying

vo = vo(go + 81) + 4180, Yr = VO8rg1 + Y18r +--+: +4180 forr > 0.

Multiply through the equation for v; by s” +1 and sum over r to find (after a little work) that

The probability generating function of the 7; is therefore a constant multiplied by the coefficients of
sysl...jsk-lin go(s — 1)/(s — G(s)), the constant being chosen in such a way that a n=l.

When G(s) = p(1 — gs)~!, then gg = p and

The coefficient of 5° is 1, and of s! is git} /p' if i > 1. The stationary distribution is therefore given
by 2; = gxo(q/p)' fori = 1, where

for any 0 < p < 1.
5. (a) Set i = 1, and find an increasing sequence n1(1),1(2),... along which x;(m) converges.
Now set i = 2, and find a subsequence of (n1(j) : j = 1) along which x2(n) converges; denote
this subsequence by n2(1), n2(2),.... Continue inductively to obtain, for each i, a sequence nj =
(nj(J) : j = 1), noting that:

(i) m;41 is a subsequence of n;, and

Gi) limy—s oo xj (nj (r)) exists for all i.
Finally, define m; = n;,(k). For eachi > 1, the sequence m;, mj+1, ... is a subsequence of n;, and
therefore lim; oo x; (my) exists.
(b) Let S be the state space of the irreducible Markov chain X. There are countably many pairs i, j
of states, and part (a) may be applied to show that there exists a sequence (n, : r > 1) and a family
(aij : i, 7 € S), not all zero, such that pj; (ar) > ajj asr > oo.
