27. A bag contains red and green balls. A ball is drawn from the bag, its colour noted, and then it
is returned to the bag together with a new ball of the same colour. Initially the bag contained one
ball of each colour. If R, denotes the number of red balls in the bag after n additions, show that
Sn = Rp/(n 4+ 2) is a martingale. Deduce that the ratio of red to green balls converges almost surely
to some limit as n + ov.

28. Anscombe’s theorem. Let {X; : i > 1} be independent identically distributed random variables
with zero mean and finite positive variance o”, and let Sy = 7] X;. Suppose that the integer-valued

You should not assume that the process M is independent of the X;.

29. Kolmogorov’s inequality. Let X,, X2,... be independent random variables with zero means,
and Sy = Xj +Xo+-:-+Xn. Let My, = max) <p<y |5,%j and show that E(S2TA,) > c2P(Ag) where
Ay = {Mg_1 <c < My} andc > 0. Deduce Kolmogorov’s inequality:

(i) S772) Xi converges almost surely if S772, E(X?) < 0,
(ii) if there exists an increasing real sequence (b,) such that by, — ov, and satisfying the inequality

31. Estimating the transition matrix. The Markov chain Xo, X1,... , Xn has initial distribution
Ff, = P(Xo = i) and transition matrix P. The log-likelihood function A(P) is defined as A(P) =
log( Xo PX9,X1 PX1,X_ °°" PX,-1,Xn)- Show that:

(a) ACP) = log fxg + yi, j Ni; log pij where N;; is the number of transitions from i to j,

(b) viewed as a function of the p;;, A(P) is maximal when p;; = pjj where Dj; = Nij/3°, Nik.
(c) if X is irreducible and ergodic then p; ij aS; Pij ASN > OO.

32. Ergodic theorem in discrete time. Let X be an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain, and let
j4; be the mean recurrence time of state i. Let V;(n) = yr I,x,=i} be the number of visits to i up
