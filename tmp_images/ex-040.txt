Dependence Exercises [4.4.6]-[4.5.5]

6. Let X be N(u, o”), Show that E{(X — w)g(X)} = o7E(g’(X)) when both sides exist.

7. With the terminology of Exercise (4.1.4), find the hazard rate when:

(a) X has the Weibull distribution, P(X > x) = exp(—ax8-1), x > 0,

(b) X has the exponential distribution with parameter i,

(c) X has density function af + (1 — w)g, where 0 < a < 1 and f and g are the densities of
exponential variables with respective parameters A and jz. What happens to this last hazard rate
r(x) in the limit as x > 00?

8. Mills’s ratio. For the standard normal density ¢(x), show that ¢’(x) + x@(x) = 0. Hence show

Show that f is a continuous joint density function, but that the (first) marginal density function

Show that fg is a continuous joint density function whose first marginal density function is discon-
tinuous at the points in Q. Can you construct a continuous joint density function whose first marginal
density function is continuous nowhere?

2. Buffon’s needle revisited. Two grids of parallel lines are superimposed: the first grid contains
lines distance a apart, and the second contains lines distance b apart which are perpendicular to those
of the first set. A needle of length r (< min{a, b}) is dropped at random. Show that the probability it
intersects a line equals r(2a + 2b — r)/(2rab).

3. Buffon’s cross. The plane is ruled by the lines y = n, for n = 0, +1,..., and on to this plane
we drop a cross formed by welding together two unit needles perpendicularly at their midpoints. Let
Z be the number of intersections of the cross with the grid of parallel lines. Show that E(Z/2) = 2/x

If you had the choice of using either a needle of unit length, or the cross, in estimating 2/7, which
would you use?

4. Let X and Y be independent random variables each having the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Let
U = min{X, Y} and V = max{X, Y}. Find E(V), and hence calculate cov(U, V).

5. Let X and Y be independent continuous random variables. Show that
E(g(X)A(Y)) = E(g(X))E(A(Y)),

whenever these expectations exist. If X and Y have the exponential distribution with parameter 1, find
Efexp(4(X + Y))}.
