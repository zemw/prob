1. If P is reversible then

Suppose conversely that (x, Py) = (Px, y) for all x, y €/ 2 (sr). Choose x, y to be unit vectors with 1
in the ith and jth place respectively, to obtain the detailed balance equations x; pjj = 7; pji-

2. Just check that 0 < 5;; < 1 and that the p;;j = gj; bj; satisfy the detailed balance equations
(6.14.3).

3. Itis immediate that pj, = |Ajx|, the Lebesgue measure of Aj. This is a method for simulating
a Markov chain with a given transition matrix.

4. (a) Note first from equation (4.12.7) that d(U) = 5 SUP; dry (u;., uj.), where uj. is the mass
function u;;, t € T. The required inequality may be hacked out, but instead we will use the maximal
coupling of Exercises (4.12.4, 5); see also Problem (7.11.16). Thus requires a little notation. For
i,j € S,i # j, we find a pair (X;, X;) of random variables taking values in T according to the

marginal mass functions u;., 4j., and such that P(X; # Xj) = sary (uj., uj.). The existence of
such a pair was proved in Exercise (4.12.5). Note that the value of X; depends on j, but this fact
has been suppressed from the notation for ease of reading. Having found (X;, X;), we find a pair
(Y(X;), ¥(X;)) taking values in U according to the marginal mass functions v Xj UX;5 and such that

P(Y (Xi) A Y(X;) | Xi, Xj) = S4tv (vx; Ux;.)- Now, taking a further liberty with the notation,

P(Y(X;) # ¥(Xj)) =\ 5 PU =r, Xj = SPO £4 YO))

and the claim follows.
(b) Write S = {1, 2,..., m}, and take

ya {PXo=)D PXo=2) --- P(Xo =m)
~\ PY =1) P(¥p =2) --- PY =m) /°

The claim follows by repeated application of the result of part (a).
It may be shown with the aid of a little matrix theory that the second largest eigenvalue of a finite
stochastic matrix P is no larger in modulus that d(P); cf. the equation prior to Theorem (6.14.9).
