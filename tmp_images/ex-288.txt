Classification of chains Solutions [6.3.6]-[6.3.9]

6. Let Pi) = PC | Xo = 2). It is trivial that n; = 1 for j <¢ A. For j ¢ A, condition on the first
step and use the Markov property to obtain

nj = >> pjeP(Ta < 00 | X1 = 1) = © vyene.

If x = (x; : j € S) is any non-negative solution of these equations, then x; = 1 > nj for j ¢ A. For
JA,

xj = > Pik = > Pik + S> PjkXk =Pi(Ta =D 4+ S> DjkXk

We obtain by iteration that, for j ¢ A,

xy =P(Ta Sat So Pik Phy ky °° * Pkt —\skn¥kn 2 P(Ta <n),

where the sum is over all kj, ko,...,kn ¢ A. We let n — oo to find that x; > Pj(T4 < 00) =7nj;.

7, The first part follows as in Exercise (6.3.6). Suppose x = (x; : j € S) is a non-negative solution
to the equations. As above, for j ¢ A,

xj= tt So jee =P)(T4 >= 1+ > Pik ¢ + > puis)

where the penultimate sum is over all paths of length n that do not visit A. We let n — oo to obtain
that x; = Ej(T4) = 9;.

8. Yes, because the 5; and 7; are stopping times whenever they are finite. Whether or not the exit
times are stopping times depends on their exact definition. The times U; = min{k > U,_1 : Xu, €
A, Xy,+1 ¢ A} are not stopping times, but the times U; + 1 are stopping times.

9. (a) Using the aperiodicity of j, there exist integers r1,r2,..., 7s having highest common factor
1 and such that p; jE) > Ofor 1 < k <s. There exists a positive integer M such that, ifr > M, then
r = Y=) 4ere for some sequence a1, a2,..., as of non-negative integers. Now, by the Chapman—

Kolmogorov equations,

S
pir) = ]] pyre > 0,
k=1

so that pjj(r) > O for allr > M.
Finally, find m such that p;;(m) > 0. Then

PyT+m)= pij(m)pjy7)>0  ifr>= M.

(b) Since there are only finitely many pairs i, j, the maximum R(P) = max{M(i, j) : i, 7 € S}is
finite. Now R(P) depends only on the positions of the non-negative entries in the transition matrix P.
