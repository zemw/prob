4.10 Exercises. Distributions arising from the normal distribution

1, Let X, and X4 be independent variables with the x2(m) and x2(n) distributions respectively.
Show that X, + X9 has the x2(m +n) distribution.

2. Show that the mean of the t(r) distribution is 0, and that the mean of the F(r, s) distribution is
s/(s — 2) if s > 2. What happens if s < 2?

3. Show that the ¢(1) distribution and the Cauchy distribution are the same.

4. Let X and Y be independent variables having the exponential distribution with parameter 1. Show
that X/Y has an F distribution. Which?

5. Use the result of Exercise (4.5.7) to show the independence of the sample mean and sample
variance of an independent sample from the N (i, o2) distribution.

6. Let {X,; : 1 < r < n} be independent N(0, 1) variables. Let Y e€ [0,2] be the angle
between the vector (X,, X2,..., Xn) and some fixed vector in R”. Show that W has density
fh) = Gin wy"? BA, In - 3). 0 < y < x, where B is the beta function.

4.11 Exercises. Sampling from a distribution

1. Uniform distribution. If U is uniformly distributed on [0, 1], what is the distribution of X =
[nU}4+1?

2. Random permutation. Given the first n integers in any sequence Sg, proceed thus:

(a) pick any position Pp from {1, 2,... ,m} at random, and swap the integer in that place of Sg with
the integer in the nth place of So, yielding Sj.
(b) pick any position P, from {1,2,...,— 1} at random, and swap the integer in that place of Sj

with the integer in the (n ~— 1)th place of S1, yielding S»,

(c) at the (r — 1)th stage the integer in position P,_ , chosen randomly from {1,2,...,2 —r+ 1},
is swapped with the integer at the (x — r + 1)th place of the sequence S,_ .

Show that S, 1 is equally likely to be any of the n! permutations of {1, 2,..., n}.

3. Gamma distribution. Use the rejection method to sample from the gamma density ['(A, t) where
t (> 1) may not be assumed integral. [Hint: You might want to start with an exponential random
variable with parameter 1/t.]

4. Beta distribution. Show how to sample from the beta density B(a, 8) where a, 8 > 1. [Hint:
Use Exercise (3).]

5. Describe three distinct methods of sampling from the density f(x) = 6x(1 —x), O<x <1.

6. Aliasing method. A finite real vector is called a probability vector if it has non-negative entries
with sum 1. Show that a probability vector p of length n may be written in the form

1 n
Pro] du

where each v;, is a probability vector with at most two non-zero entries. Describe a method, based on
this observation, for sampling from p viewed as a probability mass function.

7. Box-Muller normals. Let U; and U2 be independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1], and
let T; = 2U; — 1. Show that, conditional on the event that R = \/T? + T? <1,
