[3.11.22]-{3.11.30] Exercises Discrete random variables

(d) For the given population, how improbable should the characteristics of the criminal be, in order
that he (or she) be specified uniquely?

22. In 1710, J. Arbuthnot observed that male births had exceeded female births in London for 82
successive years. Arguing that the two sexes are equally likely, and 2~82 is very small, he attributed
this run of masculinity to Divine Providence. Let us assume that each birth results in a girl with
probability p = 0.485, and that the outcomes of different confinements are independent of each other.
Ignoring the possibility of twins (and so on), show that the probability that girls outnumber boys in 2n
live births is no greater than 2") P"a"{q/(q — p)}, where q = 1 — p. Suppose that 20,000 children
are born in each of 82 successive years. Show that the probability that boys outnumber girls every
year is at least 0.99. You may need Stirling’s formula.

23. Consider a symmetric random walk with an absorbing barrier at N and a reflecting barrier at 0
(so that, when the particle is at 0, it moves to 1 at the next step). Let a, (j) be the probability that
the particle, having started at k, visits 0 exactly j times before being absorbed at N. We make the
convention that, if k = 0, then the starting point counts as one visit. Show that

N-k 1\J7!

24. Problem of the points (3.9.4). A coin is tossed repeatedly, heads turning up with probability p
on each toss. Player A wins the game if heads appears at least m times before tails has appeared n
times; otherwise player B wins the game. Find the probability that A wins the game.

25. A coin is tossed repeatedly, heads appearing on each toss with probability p. A gambler starts
with initial fortune k (where 0 < k < N); he wins one point for each head and loses one point for
each tail. If his fortune is ever 0 he is bankrupted, whilst if it ever reaches N he stops gambling to buy

a Jaguar. Suppose that p < 4 Show that the gambler can increase his chance of winning by doubling
the stakes. You may assume that k and N are even.
What is the corresponding strategy if p > 5?

26. A compulsive gambler is never satisfied. At each stage he wins £1 with probability p and loses
£1 otherwise. Find the probability that he is ultimately bankrupted, having started with an initial
fortune of £k.

27. Range of random walk. Let {X, : n > 1} be independent, identically distributed random
variables taking integer values. Let Sp = 0, Sy = S07, X;. The range Ry of So, S1,..., Sn is the
number of distinct values taken by the sequence. Show that P(Ry = R,-1 +1) = P(S1S2--- Sp #9),
and deduce that, asn —> ov,

—E(Rn) > PCS, # 0 for all k > 1).

Hence show that, for the simple random walk, n—B(Ry) —> |p—gq|asn > oo.

28. Arc sine law for maxima. Consider a symmetric random walk S starting from the origin, and
let M, = max{S; :0 <i <n}. Show that, for i = 2k, 2k + 1, the probability that the walk reaches
Moy, for the first time at time i equals A P(Soy = 0)P(S2,_2,% = 0).

29. Let S be a symmetric random walk with Sg = 0, and let N, be the number of points that have
been visited by S exactly once up to time n. Show that E(V,) = 2.

30. Family planning. Consider the following fragment of verse entitled ‘Note for the scientist’.

People who have three daughters try for more,
And then its fifty—fifty they'll have four,
Those with a son or sons will let things be,
