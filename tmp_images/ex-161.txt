[2.2.1]-[2.4.1] Solutions Random variables and their distributions

2.2 Solutions. The law of averages

1. Let p be the potentially embarrassed fraction of the population, and suppose that each sampled
individual would truthfully answer “yes” with probability p independently of all other individuals.
In the modified procedure, the chance that someone says yes is p + (1 —-p= 5 + p). If the
proportion of yes’s is now ¢, then 2¢ — 1 is a decent estimate of p.

The advantage of the given procedure is that it allows individuals to answer “yes” without their
being identified with certainty as having the embarrassing property.

2. Clearly H, + T, =n, so that (Hy, — Ty)/n = (2H, /n) — 1. Therefore
1 1
P(2p-1-e< + (Fy = Ts) $ 2p ~1 +6) =P ([o tp <5) >i

as n — oo, by the law of large numbers (2.2.1).

3. Let J, (x) be the indicator function of the event {X, < x}. By the law of averages, no} =| I)
converges in the sense of (2.2.1) and (2.2.6) to P(X, <x) = F(x).

2.3 Solutions. Discrete and continuous variables

1. With 6 = sup,, |am — @m—1|, we have that
|F(x) — G(x)| < |F(@m) — F(@m—1)| < |F@ + 8) — Fe — 8)}
for x € [am_—1, 4m). Hence G(x) approaches F (x) for any x at which F is continuous.

2. For y lying in the range of g, {Y < y}={X < eg lM} eF

3. Certainly Y is arandom variable, using the result of the previous exercise (2). Also
P(Y < y)=P(F7'(X) < y) = P(X < FQ) = FO)

as required. If F is discontinuous then F —l(x) is not defined for all x, so that Y is not well defined.
If F is non-decreasing and continuous, but not strictly increasing, then F—! (x) is not always defined
uniquely. Such difficulties may be circumvented by defining F —l¢x) = inffy : F(y) = x}.

4. The function Af+(1—A)g is non-negative and integrable over R to 1. Finally, fg is not necessarily
a density, though it may be: e.g.,if f= g=1,0<x <1then f@&)g(@x) =1,0<x <1.

5. (a)Ifd > 1, then fro cx 4 dx = c/(d —1). Therefore f is a density function if c = d — 1, and
F(x) = 1—x—@—) when this holds. If d < 1, then J has infinite integral and cannot therefore be a
density function. .

(b) By differentiating F(x) = e*/(1 + e*), we see that F is the distribution function, and c = 1.

2.4 Solutions. Worked examples
1 @ilfy>0,
P(X? < y) =P(X < Vy) — P(X < -J/¥) = F(/9) — F(-V9).
(b) We must assume that X > 0. If y > 0,

P(VX < y)=PO<X <y’) = F(y”).
