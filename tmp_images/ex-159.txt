Then for € = a the first is SL. the second is 7 as you would expect if you look at Problem (1.8.35).
37. Use induction. The inductive step employs Boole’s inequality and the fact that

n+l n n
P(U Ar) = P(An41) +P(U Ar) -P(Uu, Ane):
r=1

r=1 r=1

38. We propose to prove by induction that

P(U Ar) < STP CA) — $2 P(A, 9 Aj).
r=1 r=]

2<r<n

There is nothing special about the choice of A; in this inequality, which will therefore hold with any
suffix k playing the role of the suffix 1. Kounias’s inequality is then implied.

The above inequality holds trivially when n = 1. Assume that it holds for some value of n (> 1).
We have that

n+l n n
°(U Ar) =( Ar) + P(An+1) =P(Anai n U*)

since P(An41 9 At) < P(An41 MUSE Ar):

39, We take n > 2. We may assume without loss of generality that the seats are labelled 1,2,...,n,
and that the passengers are labelled by their seat assignments. Write F for the event that the last
passenger finds his assigned seat to be free. Let K (> 2) be the seat taken by passenger 1, so that
P(F) = (n— pT! he a, wherea, = P(F | K =k). Note thata, = 0. Passengers 2,3,..., K—1
occupy their correct seats. Passenger K either occupies seat 1, in which case all subsequent passengers
take their correct seats, or he occupies some seat L satisfying L > K. In the latter case, passengers
K+1,K+2,...,L—1 are correctly seated. We obtain thus that

Oe = oe tht Mkt + 42 Fo + Mn), 2<k <n.

Therefore a, = 5 for 2 <k <n, by induction, and so P(F) = 4(n — 2)/(n - 1).
