Problems Solutions [6.15.29]-[6.15.31]

From the process Y we may generate the process X in the following way. At the epoch of each
disaster, we paint every member of the population grey. At any given time, the unpainted individuals
constitute X, and the aggregate population constitutes Y. When constructed in this way, it is the case
that Y(t) < X(t), so that Y is a Markov chain which is dominated by a chain having a stationary
distribution. It follows that X has a stationary distribution 7 (the state 0 is persistent for X, and
therefore persistent for Y also).

Suppose X is in equilibrium. The times of disasters form a Poisson process with intensity 6. At
any given time f, the elapsed time T since the last disaster is exponentially distributed with parameter
5. At the time of this disaster, the value of X(t) is reduced to 0 whatever its previous value.

It follows by averaging over the value of T that the generating function H(s) = )>7o.ps"zn of
X(t) is given by

by the substitution x = e~“”. The mean of X(t) is

29. Let G(|B|, s) be the generating function of X(B). If BNC = @, then X(BUC) = X(B)4+X(C),
so that G(a+ 6, s) = G(a, s)G(f, s) for |s| < 1,a, 6 = 0. The only solutions to this equation which
are monotone in & are of the form G(a, s) = e®“) for |s| < 1, and for some function A(s). Now any
interval may be divided into n equal sub-intervals, and therefore G(q, s) is the generating function of
an infinitely divisible distribution. Using the result of Problem (5.12.13b), A(s) may be written in the
form A(s) = (A(s) — 1)A for some A and some probability generating function A(s) = iw ajs* . We
now use (iii): if |B| = a,
P(X(B)=>1) 1 -—e%@o-)

P(X(B)=1) — ardaye**@0-D)

asa | 0. Therefore ag + a; = 1, and hence A(s) = ag + (1 — ag)s, and X(B) has a Poisson
distribution with parameter proportional to |B].

30. (a) Let M(r, s) be the number of points of the resulting process on R+ lying in the interval (7, s].
Since disjoint intervals correspond to disjoint annuli of the plane, the process M has independent
increments in the sense that M(r1, 51), M(r2, 52), ..., M(rn, sn) are independent whenever rj <
Sy <Q <-+: <1 < Sp. Furthermore, forr <s andk > 0,

x _ k j~An(s—r)

and the claim follows by differentiating, and utilizing the successive cancellation.

31. The number X(S) of points within the sphere with volume S and centre at the origin has the
Poisson distribution with parameter AS. Hence P(X (S$) = 0) = e745, implying that the volume V of
the largest such empty ball has the exponential distribution with parameter A.
