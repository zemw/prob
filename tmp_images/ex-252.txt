Characteristic functions Solutions [5.7.7]-[5.7.9]

Now g(x) is a finite linear combination of functions of the form cl, (x) for reals c and intervals
A, that is ge(x) = a cxTa, &); elementary integration yields

eitbe _ pitay

bet) = ae

where ay and by are the endpoints of A,. Therefore

etn <2 a0, ast —> oo.
k=1

7. If X is N(u, 1), then the moment generating function of X 2 is

2 OO 2 1 Ll gy_y)2 1 ps
My2(s) = E(e®* -| sx" OM) gy — ex ;
x28) ( ) 00. Vin * 1 — 2s P 1—2s

ifs < 4, by completing the square in the exponent. It follows that

= I “js 1 $0
My(s) = |] J = .
r= | spo (51% aaa? (75)

j=l

It is tempting to substitute s = it to obtain the answer. This procedure may be justified in this case
using the theory of analytic continuation.

8. (a) T2 = X2/(Y/n), where X2 is x2(1; 42) by Exercise (5.7.7), and Y is x2(n). Hence T? is
F(1,n; w?).
(b) F has the same distribution function as

_ (A? +.B)/m
~ Vin

where A, B, V are independent, A being N (/6, 1), B being x2(m — 1), and V being x2(n). Therefore

5 B/(m —1)
E(Z) = ~ {ECA )E (=) +(m — DE (Ae-”)}

i _ n _ n(m+8)
= {d+ O25 tlm yp }- ner.

where we have used the fact (see Exercise (4.10.2)) that the F(r, s) distribution has mean s/(s — 2)
ifs > 2.

9. Let X be independent of X with the same distribution. Then |@|2 is the characteristic function of
X — X and, by the inversion theorem,

l “ —itx 9°
=|. \p@)?e" dt = fy x(x) =f. f(y) f(x + y) dy.

Now set x = 0. We require that the density function of X — X be differentiable at 0.
