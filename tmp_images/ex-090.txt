Initially V(0) = 4. Let

(a) Show that

aG

and deduce that G(s,t) ={1+(1—s)t}7!.
(b) Show that the expected length m,(T) of time for which V = n+ 5 during the time interval [0, T]
is given by

T
my (T) = i P(V(t)=n+4)dt

and that, for fixed k, mg (T) — log T > — a i-1asT > oo.

(c) What is the expected velocity of the particle at time t?
34, A random sequence of non-negative integers {X, : n > 0} begins Xo = 0, X, = 1, and is
produced by

x Xn+Xpn—1 with probability 4,

+1= . as
. [Xp — Xy,-1| with probability I

Show that ¥, = (X,—1, Xn) is a transient Markov chain, and find the probability of ever reaching
(1, 1) from (1, 2).
35. Take a regular hexagon and join opposite corners by straight lines meeting at the point C. A
particle performs a symmetric random walk on these 7 vertices, starting at A. Find:
(a) the probability of return to A without hitting C,
(b) the expected time to return to A,
(c) the expected nmber of visits to C before returning to A,
(d) the expected time to return to A, given that there is no prior visit to C.

36. Diffusion, osmosis. Markov chains are defined by the following procedures at any time n:

(a) Bernoulli model. Two adjacent containers A and B each contain m particles; m are of type I and
m are of type II. A particle is selected at random in each container. If they are of opposite types
they are exchanged with probability a if the type I is in A, or with probability 6 if the type I is in
B. Let Xy be the number of type I particles in A at time n.

(b) Ehrenfest dog-flea model. Two adjacent containers contain m particles in all. A particle is
selected at random. If it is in A it is moved to B with probability a, if it is in B it is moved to A
with probability 8. Let Y, be the number of particles in A at time n.

In each case find the transition matrix and stationary distribution of the chain.

37. Let X be an irreducible continuous-time Markov chain on the state space S with transition prob-
abilities p;,(¢) and unique stationary distribution 7, and write P(X(t) = j) = aj(¢). If c(x) isa
concave function, show that d(t) = Dies 1;C(a;(t)/m;) increases to c(1) as t > oo.

38. With the notation of the preceding problem, let u,(t) = P(X(t) = k | X(O) = 0), and suppose
the chain is reversible in equilibrium (see Problem (6.15.16)). Show that ug(2t) = > j (mo/1j)uj (0),
and deduce that ug(t) decreases to 19 as t > 00.

39, Perturbing a Poisson process. Let ITI be the set of points in a Poisson process on R? with
constant intensity A. Each point is displaced, where the displacements are independent and identically
distributed. Show that the resulting point process is a Poisson process with intensity A.
