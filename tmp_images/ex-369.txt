[9.5.3]-[9.6.3] Solutions Stationary processes

3. It is easily seen that Sm = 57729 aj Xn+i Constitutes a martingale with respect to the X’s, and

m CO
E(Sp,) = > oF E(Xn 41) S > oe,
i=0 i=0

whence S,, converges a.s. and in mean square as m —> 00.

Since the X, are independent and identically distributed, the sequence Y, is strongly stationary;
also E(Y,) = 0, and so nl a Y; — Z a.s. and in mean, for some random variable Z with mean
zero. For any fixed m (> 1), the contribution of X;, X2,..., Xm towards an Y; is, for large n, no
larger than

Cn = S>@o + ay +--+ +aj.1)X;).

j=l

Now n-!Cm — 0 as n — oo, so that Z is defined in terms of the subsequence X41, Xm+2,---
for all m, which is to say that Z is a tail function of a sequence of independent random variables.
Therefore Z is a.s. constant, and so Z = Oa.s.

1. The quick way is to observe that c is the autocovariance function of a Poisson process with
intensity 1. Alternatively, argue as follows. The sum is unchanged by taking complex conjugates, and

hence is real. Therefore it equals

2. Fors,t > 0, X(s) and X(s + ¢) have a bivariate normal distribution with zero means, unit
variances, and covariance c(t). It is standard (see Problem (4.14.13)) that E(X(s +t) | X(s)) =
c(t)X(s). Now

o(s +1) = E(XO)X(s + 1)) = E{E(X(OX(s +1)| XO, X(s))}
= E(X(O)c(t)X(s)) = e(s)e(t)

by the Markov property. Therefore c satisfies c(s + t) = c(s)c(t), c(O) = 1, whence c(s) = c(1)s! =

Note that X has the same autocovariance function as a certain autoregressive process. Indeed,
stationary Gaussian Markov processes have such a representation.

3. If X is Gaussian and strongly stationary, then it is weakly stationary since it has a finite variance.
Conversely suppose X is Gaussian and weakly stationary. Then c(s, f) = cov(X(s), X(#)) depends
