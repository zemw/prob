13. Let m(t) be the mean number of living individuals at time t in an age-dependent branching process
with exponential lifetimes, parameter A, and mean family size v (> 1). Prove that m(t) = I e—Dat
where J is the number of initial members.

14. Alternating renewal process. The interarrival times of this process are Zg, Yj, Z1, Yo,...,
where the ¥; and Z; are independent with respective common moment generating functions My and
Mz. Let p(t) be the probability that the epoch ¢ of time lies in an interval of type Z. Show that the
Laplace-Stieltjes transform p* of p satisfies

1— Mz(-6)
— My(—0)Mz(—8)

15. Type 2 counters. Particles are detected by a Type 2 counter of the following sort. The incoming
particles constitute a Poisson process with intensity A. The jth particle locks the counter for a length
Y; of time, and annuls any after-effect of its predecessors. Suppose that Y;, Y2, ... are independent of
each other and of the Poisson process, each having distribution function G. The counter is unlocked
at time 0.

Let L be the (maximal) length of the first interval of time during which the counter is locked.
Show that H(t) = P(L > 1) satisfies

HQ) =e“[1- GQ] +f Hi —x){l— G(x)Jae7* dx.

Solve for H in terms of G, and evaluate the ensuing expression in the case G(x) = 1 — e~¥* where
p> 0.

16. Thinning. Consider a renewal process N, and suppose that each arrival is ‘overlooked’ with
probability g, independently of all other arrivals. Let M(t) be the number of arrivals which are
detected up to time t/p where p = 1 — q.

(a) Show that M is a renewal process whose interarrival time distribution function Fp is given by
Fy(x) = ean pq —IF. (x/p), where F,, is the distribution function of the time of the nth
arrival in the original process N.

(b) Find the characteristic function of F, in terms of that of F, and use the continuity theorem to
show that, as p | 0, Fp(s) > 1- e~5/¥ for s > 0,80 long as the interarrival times in the original
process have finite mean jz. Interpret!

(c) Suppose that p < 1, and M and N are processes with the same fdds. Show that N is a Poisson
process.

17. (a) A PC keyboard has 100 different keys and a monkey is tapping them (uniformly) at random.
Assuming no power failure, use the elementary renewal theorem to find the expected number of
keys tapped until the first appearance of the sequence of fourteen characters ‘W. Shakespeare’.
Answer the same question for the sequence ‘omo’.

(b) Acoin comes up heads with probability p on each toss. Find the mean number of tosses until the
first appearances of the sequences (i) HHH, and (ii) HTH.

18. Let N be a stationary renewal process. Let s be a fixed positive real number, and define X(t) =
N(s +t) — N(t) for t = 0. Show that X is a strongly stationary process.

19. Bears arrive in a village at the instants of a renewal process; they are captured and confined at a
cost of $c per unit time per bear. When a given number B bears have been captured, an expedition
(costing $d) is organized to remove and release them a long way away. What is the long-run average
cost of this policy?
