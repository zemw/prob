13.9 Exercises. It6’s formula

In the absence of any contrary indication, W denotes a standard Wiener process, and F; is the smallest
o-field containing all null events with respect to which every member of (Wy, : 0 < u < t} is
measurable.

1, Let X and Y be independent standard Wiener processes. Show that, with R? = X? + Y?,

a4 ty,
Z= | dx [ee
t [ Rs s+ 0 Rs Ss

is a Wiener process. [Hint: Use Theorem (13.8.13).] Hence show that R? satisfies
t
R? =2/ Rs dWs + 2t.
0

Generalize this conclusion to n dimensions.

2. Write down the SDE obtained via It6’s formula for the process ¥; = w; , and deduce that
EW) = 317.

3. Show that Y; = 1W,; is an It6 process, and write down the corresponding SDE.

4. Wiener process on a circle. Let Y; = e!%_ Show that Y = X 1 +iX2 is a process on the unit
circle satisfying

dX, = —4Xx, dt—XzdW, dX2z= —4Xdt +X ,dw.

5. Find the SDEs satisfied by the processes:

(a) Xr = Wi/U +1),

(b) X; = sin W,,

(c) [Wiener process on an ellipse] X; = acos W;, Y; = b sin W;, where ab #4 0.

13.10 Exercises. Option pricing

In the absence of any contrary indication, W denotes a standard Wiener process, and F; is the smallest
o-field containing all null events with respect to which every member of {W, : 0 < u < ft} is
measurable. The process S; = exp((u — 507) +oW,) is a geometric Brownian motion, and r > 0
is the interest rate.

1. (a) Let Z have the N(y, 12) distribution. Show that

E((ae~ —K)*) = acVt30 @ (eecry + r) —Ko (Ree +r)

where ® is the N(0, 1) distribution function.
(b) Let Q be a probability measure under which oW is a Wiener process with drift r — uw and
instantaneous variance a2. Show for 0 <t<T that

Eg((Sr — K)+ | F) = Sre"F—9 @ (dy, S:)) — K (dot, S:))
where

log(x/K) + (r + 402)(T —1)
oV/T —-t ,
