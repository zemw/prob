Problems Exercises [1.8.4]-[1.8.14]

4. Describe the underlying probability spaces for the following experiments:

(a) a biased coin is tossed three times;

(b) two balls are drawn without replacement from an urn which originally contained two ultramarine
and two vermilion balls;

(c) a biased coin is tossed repeatedly until a head turns up.

5. Show that the probability that exactly one of the events A and B occurs is

P(A) + P(B) — 2P(AN B).

6. Prove that P(AU BUC) =1—P(AS | BSN C°)P(BS | CPCS).

7. (a)If A is independent of itself, show that P(A) is 0 or 1.
(b) If P(A) is 0 or 1, show that A is independent of all events B.

8. Let Fbeac-field of subsets of Q, and suppose P : ¥ -> [0, 1] satisfies: (4) P(&2) = 1, and Gi) P
is additive, in that P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) whenever AM B = @. Show that P(@) = 0.

9, Suppose (Q, ¥, P) is a probability space and B € F satisfies P(B) > 0. Let Q: F — [0, 1] be
defined by Q(A) = P(A | B). Show that (Q, F, Q) is a probability space. If C € Fand Q(C) > 0,
show that Q(A | C) = P(A | BNC); discuss.

10. Let By, Bo,... be a partition of the sample space Q, each B; having positive probability, and
show that

13. Let Aj, Az,..., An be events, and let Ny be the event that exactly k of the A; occur. Prove the
result sometimes referred to as Waring’s theorem:

Use this result to find an expression for the probability that a purchase of six packets of Corn Flakes
yields exactly three distinct busts (see Exercise (1.3.4)).
14. Prove Bayes’s formula: if A;, Az, ..., An isa partition of Q, each A; having positive probability,
