where c = (b — pa)/+/1 — p2,d = (a— pb)/V/1 — 02, and @ and © are the density and distribution
function of the N(O, 1) distribution.

13. Let X have the Cauchy distribution. Show that Y = X~! has the Cauchy distribution also. Find
another non-trivial distribution with this property of invariance.

14. Let X and Y be independent and gamma distributed as (A, a), P(A, B) respectively. Show that
W = X+4+Y and Z = X/(X +Y) are independent, and that Z has the beta distribution with parameters

a, B.

4.8 Exercises. Sums of random variables

1. Let X and Y be independent variables having the exponential distribution with parameters A and
pe respectively. Find the density function of X + Y.

2. Let X and Y be independent variables with the Cauchy distribution. Find the density function of

3. Find the density function of Z = X + Y when X and Y have joint density function f(x, y) =
Lox + ye Ot”), x,y >0.

4. Hypoexponential distribution. Let {X; : r => 1} be independent exponential random variables

with respective parameters {A, : r > 1} no two of which are equal. Find the density function of

Sn = >0Y_, Xr. [Hint: Use induction.]

5. (a) Let X, Y, Z be independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Find the density function of

yo Xp at any point x € (0, n) is a polynomial in x of degree n — 1.

6. For independent identically distributed random variables X and Y, show that U = X + Y and
V = X — ¥ are uncorrelated but not necessarily independent. Show that U and V are independent if
X and Y are N(0, 1).
