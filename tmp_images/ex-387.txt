[10.6.8]-[10.6.10] Solutions Renewals

We have that
t
P(E@) <y)=F(+y) -[ {1— Fa +y—-x)}dm(x).

By the renewal equation,

ty
m+) = Forty) | F(t + y —x)dm(x),

whence, by subtraction,

t+y
P(E(t)<y)= | {1- F(t +y—x)}dm(a).
t
It follows that

P(X; <x) = [| {I= FG —y) hdmi dFLO

= [rio [ (1-Fa-y}amyy] + f Fr(){1— Fe —D)}dm@

using integration by parts. The term in square brackets equals 0.

8. (a) Each interarrival time has the same distribution as the sum of two independent random variables
with the exponential distribution. Therefore N(t) has the same distribution as [5M (t)| where Misa
Poisson process with intensity 4. Therefore m(t) = 5E(M (t)) - 5P(M (t) is odd). Now E(M(#)) =

P(M(t) is odd) = }>

With more work, one may establish the probability generating function of N(t).
(b) Doing part (a) as above, one may see that m(t) = m(t).

9. Clearly C(t) and E(t) are independent if the process N is a Poisson process. Conversely, suppose
that C(t) and E(t) are independent, for each fixed choice of t. The event {C(t) > y}N{E@ = x}
occurs if and only if E(t — y) > x + y. Therefore

P(C(@) > y)P(E(@) => x) =P(E@-—y)>x+y).
Take the limit as t — oo, remembering Exercise (10.3.3) and Problem (10.6.4), to obtain that
G(y)G(«*) = Ga + y) if x, y > 0, where

G(u) = | —[1 — F(v)) dv.
u bb

Now 1 — G is a distribution function, and hence has the lack-of-memory property (Problem (4.14.5)),
implying that G(u) = e * for some A. This implies in turn that [1 — F(u)]/u = —G’(u) = new *@
whence 4 = 1/d and F(u) =1—-— ef,

10. Clearly N is a renewal process if Nz is Poisson. Suppose that N is a renewal process, and write
A for the intensity of N,, and F> for the interarrival time distribution of N2. By considering the time
X, to the first arrival of N,

(x) 1 — F(x) = P(N1 (x) = No(x) = 0) = e** (1 — Fo(x)).
