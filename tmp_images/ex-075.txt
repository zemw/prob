[6.3.1]-[6.3.8] Exercises Markov chains

6.3 Exercises. Classification of chains

1. Let X be a Markov chain on {0, 1, 2,...} with transition matrix given by po j = aj for j > 0,
Pii =r and p;;-) = 1 —r fori > 1. Classify the states of the chain, and find their mean recurrence
times.

2. Determine whether or not the random walk on the integers having transition probabilities p; ;42 =
P, Pii-1 = 1 — p, for all i, is persistent.

3. Classify the states of the Markov chains with transition matrices

1-—2p 2p 0
(a) p  1—2p~ p ,
0 2p 1-—2p
0 p 0 1-p
1-—p 0 Pp 0
(b) 0 1l-p 0 Pp
Pp 0 1l-—p 0

In each case, calculate p;;(n) and the mean recurrence times of the states.

4. A particle performs a random walk on the vertices of a cube. At each step it remains where it is
with probability i, or moves to one of its neighbouring vertices each having probability i. Let v and
w be two diametrically opposite vertices. If the walk starts at v, find:

(a) the mean number of steps until its first return to v,

(b) the mean number of steps until its first visit to w,

(c) the mean number of visits to w before its first return to v.

5. Visits. With the notation of Exercise (6.2.4), show that

(a) ifi > j and i is persistent, then yj; = nj; = 1,

(b) nj; = 1 ifand only if PZ; < co | X9 =I) =P <wo|Xo=f=l.

6. First passages. Let T4 = min{n > 0: Xy, € A}, where X is a Markov chain and A is a subset
of the state space S, and let nj = P(T4 < co | Xo = j). Show that

1 ifjeA,
=) S” pjem iff ¢ A.
keS

Show further that if x = (x; : j € S) is any non-negative solution of these equations then x; > nj; for
all j.

7, Mean first passage. In the notation of Exercise (6), let 0; = E(T4 | Xo = j). Show that

0 ifjeA,
PI=YV1+>0 Djeoe if i ¢ A,
keS
and that if x = (x; : j € S) is any non-negative solution of these equations then x; > 0; for all j.

8. Let X be an irreducible Markov chain and let A be a subset of the state space. Let S, and T,
be the successive times at which the chain enters A and visits A respectively. Are the sequences
{Xs 17 = 1}, {Xz 2 r => 1} Markov chains? What can be said about the times at which the chain
exits A?
