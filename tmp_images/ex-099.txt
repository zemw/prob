[7.8.1]-[7.9.5] Exercises Convergence of random variables

7.8 Exercises. Martingale convergence theorem

1. Kolmogorov’s inequality. Let X;, X2,... be independent random variables with zero means
and finite variances, and let S, = X, + X2 +---+ Xy. Use the Doob—Kolmogorov inequality to
show that

l<jxn

1 n
P ( max Isj1>) Sy vax) fore > 0.
j=l

2. Let X,,X2,... be independent random variables such that 5, n2 var(Xn) < co. Use Kol-
mogorov’s inequality to prove that

3 X; — E(Xi) as,
—————_ —> Y asn > oOo,

; i
i=l

for some finite random variable Y, and deduce that
1< as.
-5 (Xj — EX;) —>0 asn —> oo,
n
i=]

(You may find Kronecker’s lemma to be useful: if (ay) and (by) are real sequences with by, + oo and
3; 4;/bj < 00, then bz! ye a > Oasn > 00.)

3. Let S be a martingale with respect to X, such that E(S2) < K < oo for some K € R. Suppose
that var(S,) —> 0 as n — ov, and prove that S = limy-so9 Sp exists and is constant almost surely.

7.9 Exercises. Prediction and conditional expectation

1. Let Y be uniformly distributed on [—1, 1] and let X¥ = Y?.
(a) Find the best predictor of X given Y, and of Y given X.
(b) Find the best linear predictor of X given Y, and of Y given X.

2. Let the pair (X, Y) have a general bivariate normal distribution. Find E(Y | X).

3. Let X1, X2,.--, Xn be random variables with zero means and covariance matrix V = (v;;), and
let Y have finite second moment. Find the linear function h of the X; which minimizes the mean
squared error E{(Y — h(Xj,..., Xn))7}.
4. Verify the following properties of conditional expectation. You may assume that the relevant
expectations exist.
@) E{E(Y | $)} = EY).
(ii) E(@aY + BZ | 3) = aE(Y | $) + BE(Z | 9) fora, BER.
(iii) EY | 9) = Of Y > 0.
(iv) E(Y | 9) = E{E(Y | 4) | g}if 9c #.
(v) EY | $) = E(Y) if Y is independent of Ig for every G € §.
(vi) Jensen’s inequality. g{E(Y | %)} < E{g(Y) | $} for all convex functions g.
(vii) If Y, “SS Y and |Y;| < Z a.s. where E(Z) < oo, then E(¥n | 9) “SS E(Y | 9).
(Statements (ii)-(vi) are of course to be interpreted ‘almost surely’.)

5. Let X and Y have joint mass function f(x, y) = {x@ + yy} for x = y = 1,2,.... Show that
E(Y | X) < « while E(Y) = oo.
