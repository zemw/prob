Generating functions and their applications

5.1 Exercises. Generating functions

1. Find the generating functions of the following mass functions, and state where they converge.
Hence calculate their means and variances.

(a) f(m) = ("*™ 1) p" (1 — py", for m > 0.

(b) f(m) = {mm + Dy}, for m > 1.

(c) f(m) = (1 — p)p'"!/(1 + p), form =...,-1,0,1,....

The constant p satisfies 0 < p < 1.

2. Let X (= 0) have probability generating function G and write t(n) = P(X > n) for the ‘tail’
probabilities of X. Show that the generating function of the sequence {t(n) : n > O} is T(s) =
(1 — G(s))/(1 — s). Show that E(X) = T(1) and var(X) = 27’(1) + T(1) — T()?.

3. Let Gy y(s, 1) be the joint probability generating function of X and Y. Show that Gy(s) =
Gx,y(s, 1) and Gy (t) = Gy y(1, f). Show that

4. Find the joint generating functions of the following joint mass functions, and state for what values
of the variables the series converge.

(a) fU,k) = (1 —a)(B — aja p*-J—!) for 0 < k < j, where0 <a < 1a <fB.

(b) fG,k) = (e — Dew PH DI 71, for j,k = 0.

(c) fG, b= (5) pitka — p)¥-J /[klog{1/(1 — p)}], for O < j <k, k > 1, where 0 < p <1.
Deduce the marginal probability generating functions and the covariances.

5. Acoin is tossed n times, and heads turns up with probability p on each toss. Assuming the usual
independence, show that the joint probability generating function of the numbers H and T of heads
and tails is Gy,7 (x, y) = {px + (1 — p)y}". Generalize this conclusion to find the joint probability
generating function of the multinomial distribution of Exercise (3.5.1).

6. Let X have the binomial distribution bin(n, U), where U is uniform on (0, 1). Show that X is
uniformly distributed on {0, 1,2, ..., n}.
