and deduce that extinction is certain if P(X (0) < oo) = 1.

Show that PAT/I <x | X(0) =1) > e71/* as I > oo.
28. Immigration—death with disasters. Let X be an immigration—death—disaster process, that is, a
birth-death process with parameters A; = A, 4; = ijs, and with the additional possibility of ‘disasters’

which reduce the population to 0. Disasters occur at the times of a Poisson process with intensity 6,
independently of all previous births and deaths.

(a) Show that X has a stationary distribution, and find an expression for the generating function of
this distribution.

(b) Show that, in equilibrium, the mean of X(t) is A/(6 + 42).
29. With any sufficiently nice (Lebesgue measurable, say) subset B of the real line R is associated a
random variable X (B) such that
(i) X(B) takes values in {0, 1, 2,...},
(ii) if By, Bo,..., By are disjoint then X(B,), X(Bo), ..., X (Bn) are independent, and furthermore
X(By U By) = X(By) + X (Bo),
(iii) the distribution of X(B) depends only on B through its Lebesgue measure (‘length’) | B|, and
P(X(B) > 1)

————— > 1 as|B|->0.
P(X(B) = 1)

Show that X is a Poisson process.

30. Poisson forest. Let N be a Poisson process in R? with constant intensity A, and let Ray < Ray <
++ be the ordered distances from the origin of the points of the process.

(a) Show that Ri): Roy; ... are the points of a Poisson process on Ry = [0, 00) with intensity A.
(b) Show that Rig has density function

31. Let X be a n-dimensional Poisson process with constant intensity 1. Show that the volume of
the largest (n-dimensional) sphere centred at the origin which contains no point of X is exponentially
distributed. Deduce the density function of the distance R from the origin to the nearest point of
X. Show that E(R) = T(1/n)/{n(ac)!/"} where c is the volume of the unit ball of R” and I is the
gamma function.

32. A village of N + 1 people suffers an epidemic. Let X(t) be the number of ill people at time r,
and suppose that X(0) = 1 and X is a birth process with rates A; = Ai(N + 1 —i). Let T be the
length of time required until every member of the population has succumbed to the illness. Show that

where y is Euler’s constant. It is striking that E(T) decreases with N, for large N.

33. A particle has velocity V(t) at time t, where V(t) is assumed to take values in {n + 4 in > O}.
Transitions during (t,t + A) are possible as follows:

(vt 4)h+o(h) ifw=v4+1,
P(V(t+h) =w|V(@t)=v) =¢ 1-2vh+0(h)  ifw=0,
(v—})ht+o(h) ifw=v-1.
