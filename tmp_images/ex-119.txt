each detected arrival. Show that the detection process N is a renewal process with interarrival time
distribution F(x) = 1 — e~*@—) if x > T. Find an expression for P(N (t) > k).

7. Particles arrive at a Type 1 counter in the manner of a renewal process N; each detected arrival
locks the counter for a dead period of random positive length. Show that

P(X, <x) = [ [1 — F(x — y) FL) dm(y)

where F7, is the distribution function of a typical dead period.

8. (a) Show that m(t) = Sat - ae — eat ) if the interarrival times have the gamma distribution
Pa, 2).

(b) Radioactive particles arrive like a Poisson process, intensity A, at a counter. The counter fails to
register the nth arrival whenever n is odd but suffers no dead periods. Find the renewal function

m of the detection process N.

9. Show that Poisson processes are the only renewal processes with non-arithmetic interarrival times
having the property that the excess lifetime E(t) and the current lifetime C(t) are independent for
each choice of t.

10. Let N; be a Poisson process, and let N2 be a renewal process which is independent of Nj with
non-arithmetic interarrival times having finite mean. Show that N(t) = Nj (t) + No(t) is a renewal
process if and only if Nz is a Poisson process.

11. Let N be a renewal process, and suppose that F is non-arithmetic and that 02 = var(X 1) < oo.
Use the properties of the moment generating function F*(—@) of X1 to deduce the formal expansion

Prove this rigorously by showing that

where Fg is the asymptotic distribution function of the excess lifetime (see Exercise (10.3.3)), and
applying the key renewal theorem. Compare the result with the renewal theorems.
