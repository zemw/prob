5.10 Exercises. Two limit theorems

1. Prove that, for x > 0, asn — oo,

k:
KkK—5al<px/n
k x
n 1 12
b — ~e | e 2" du.
(®) 2 k! -x V2
|kK—n|<x./n

2. It is well known that infants born to mothers who smoke tend to be small and prone to a range of
ailments. It is conjectured that also they look abnormal. Nurses were shown selections of photographs
of babies, one half of whom had smokers as mothers; the nurses were asked to judge from a baby’s
appearance whether or not the mother smoked. In 1500 trials the correct answer was given 910 times.
Is the conjecture plausible? If so, why?

3. Let X have the (1, 5) distribution; given that X = x, let Y have the Poisson distribution with
parameter x. Find the characteristic function of Y, and show that

Y-E(Y) D

———_ > N(0, 1 ass > Oo.

/var(Y) (1)
Explain the connection with the central limit theorem. :
4. Let X1, X2,... be independent random variables taking values in the positive integers, whose

common distribution is non-arithmetic, in that gcd{n : P(X, = n) > 0} = 1. Prove that, for all
integers x, there exist non-negative integers r = r(x), s = s(x), such that

P(X, +--+ +X, — Xp4y —- ++ — Xr4s =x) > 0.

5. Prove the local central limit theorem for sums of random variables taking integer values. You
may assume for simplicity that the summands have span 1, in that gcd{ |x|: P(X = x) > 0} =1.

6. Let X1, X2,... be independent random variables having common density function f(x) =
1/{2|x|(log |x[)2} for |x| < e—!. Show that the Xj; have zero mean and finite variance, and that the
density function f, of Xj + X2 +---+ Xp satisfies fy(~) + oo as x — 0. Deduce that the X; do
not satisfy the local limit theorem.

7, First-passage density. Let X have the density function f(x) = /27x—3 exp(—{2x}7!), x>Q0.
Show that @(is) = E(e**) = e—V¥25, 5 > 0, and deduce that X has characteristic function
$(t) = { exp{-(1—-i)./t} ifr >0,
exp{-(1 +1)./lt]} ift <0.
(Hint: Use the result of Problem (5.12.18).]

8. Let {X; : r > 1} be independent with the distribution of the preceding Exercise (7). Let
U, =n} nr, Xr, and Ty = n—1U,,. Show that:
(a) P(U, <c) > Ofor any c < ~,

(b) T, has the same distribution as X1.
9. A-sequence of biased coins is flipped; the chance that the rth coin shows a head is ©;, where ©,

is arandom variable taking values in (0, 1). Let X, be the number of heads after n flips. Does Xp,
obey the central limit theorem when:

(a) the ©, are independent and identically distributed?
(b) ©, = @ for all r, where © is a random variable taking values in (0, 1)?
