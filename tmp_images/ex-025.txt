Discrete random variables

3.1 Exercises. Probability mass functions

1. For what values of the constant C do the following define mass functions on the positive integers
1,2,...?
(a) Geometric: f(x) = C27*.
(b) Logarithmic: f(x) = C27*/x.
(c) Inverse square: f(x) = Cx.
(d) ‘Modified’ Poisson: f (x) = C2*/x!.
2. For arandom variable X having (in turn) each of the four mass functions of Exercise (1), find:
Gi) P(X > 1),
(ii) the most probable value of X,
(iii) the probability that X is even.
3. We toss n coins, and each one shows heads with probability p, independently of each of the

others. Each coin which shows heads is tossed again. What is the mass function of the number of
heads resulting from the second round of tosses?

4. Let S, be the set of positive integers whose base-10 expansion contains exactly k elements (so
that, for example, 1024 € S4). A fair coin is tossed until the first head appears, and we write T for
the number of tosses required. We pick a random element, N say, from S7, each such element having
equal probability. What is the mass function of N?

5. Log-convexity. (a) Show that, if X is a binomial or Poisson random variable, then the mass
function f (k) = P(X =k) has the property that f(k —D f(k + 1 < f(k)”.

(b) Show that, if f(k) = 90/(k)*, k > 1, then f(kK —Df(k+1) = f(b”.

(c) Find a mass function f such that f(k)? = f(k —Df(k+1), k>1.

3.2 Exercises. Independence

1. Let X and Y be independent random variables, each taking the values —1 or 1 with probability
5. and let Z = XY. Show that X, Y, and Z are pairwise independent. Are they independent?
2.

Let X and Y be independent random variables taking values in the positive integers and having

the same mass function f(x) = 2~* for x =1,2,.... Find:
(a) Pamin{X, Y} <x), (b) P(Y > X),
(c) P(X = Y), (d) P(X = kY), for a given positive integer k,

(e) P(X divides Y), (f) P(X =rY), for a given positive rational r.
