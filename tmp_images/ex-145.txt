[1.3.2]-[1.3.4] Solutions Events and their probabilities

Also, since AN BC Aand AM BC B, P(AN B) < min{P(A), P(B)} = 5.

These bounds are attained in the following example. Pick a number atrandom from {1, 2, ..., 12}.
Taking A = {1,2,...,9} and B = {9, 10, 11, 12}, we find that AN B = {9}, and so P(A) = 3,
P(B) = 4, (AN B) = 75. To attain the upper bound for P(A M B), take A = {1,2,...,9} and
B = {1, 2, 3, 4}.

(ii) Likewise we have in this case P(A U B) < min{P(A) + P(B),1} = 1, and P(A U B) =
max{P(A), P(B)} = 3. These bounds are attained in the examples above.

2. (i) We have (using the continuity property of P) that
P(no head ever) = lim P(no head in first n tosses) = lim 27" =0,
n->OO now

so that P(some head turns up) = 1 — P(no head ever) = 1.

(ii) Given a fixed sequence s of heads and tails of length k, we consider the sequence of tosses arranged
in disjoint groups of consecutive outcomes, each group being of length k. There is probability 2—*
that any given one of these is s, independently of the others. The event {one of the first n such groups
is s} is a subset of the event {s occurs in the first nk tosses}. Hence (using the general properties of
probability measures) we have that

P(s turns up eventually) = im, P(s occurs in the first nk tosses)
> lim P(s occurs as one of the first n groups)
n> CO

=1- jim, P(none of the first n groups is s)

=1- lim (1—27*)” =1.
n> CO

3. Lay out the saucers in order, say as RRWWSS. The cups may be arranged in 6! ways, but since
each pair of a given colour may be switched without changing the appearance, there are 6!— (2!1)3 =90
distinct arrangements. By assumption these are equally likely. In how many such arrangements is
no cup on a saucer of the same colour? The only acceptable arrangements in which cups of the
same colour are paired off are WWSSRR and SSRRWW; by inspection, there are a further eight
arrangements in which the first pair of cups is either SW or WS, the second pair is either RS or SR,

and the third either RW or WR. Hence the required probability is 10/90 = 5:

4. We prove this by induction on n, considering first the casen = 2. Certainly B = (AN B)U(B\ A)
is a union of disjoint sets, so that P(B) = P(AN B) + P(B \ A). Similarly AU B = AU (B\ A), and
sO

P(AU B) = P(A) + P(B \ A) = P(A) + {P(B) — P(AN B)}.

Hence the result is true for n = 2. Let m > 2 and suppose that the result is true for n < m. Then it is
true for pairs of events, so that

m+1 m m
P( U Ai) = P(U Ai) + P(Am+1) - Pf (Ua:) n Amat}
1 1 1
= P(U Ai) +P(Am41) -»{ Ui 0 Ame)
1

Using the induction hypothesis, we may expand the two relevant terms on the right-hand side to obtain
the result.
