Option pricing Solutions [13.10.3]-[13.10.5]

by Example (13.9.7). By equation (13.10.4), the portfolio is self-financing if this equals SdS +
wre't dt, and thus we arrive at the SDE e”! dy = —SdS — 2S? dt, whence

t t
v(t, S) --| eS, dSy -o? | e "$2 du.

(c) Note first that Z,; = fo S, du satisfies dZ,; = S,; dt. By Example (13.9.8), d(S;Z;) = Z; dS; +
Ss? dt, whence
d(ES + wel) = Z, dS, 4+ SP dt+e™dw+re™ dt.

Using equation (13.10.4), the portfolio is self-financing if this equals Z; dS; + wre” dt, and thus we
require that e”’ dy = —S? dt, which is to say that

t
wt, s=- e™ $2 du,

3. We need to check equation (13.10.4) remembering that dM; = 0. Each of these portfolios is
self-financing.

(a) This case is obvious.

(b) dES + w) =d(2S? — $* — 1) = 28 dS + dt —dt =EdS.
(c) dES+ hw) =—-S—tdS+S$=édS.

(d) Recalling Example (13.9.8), we have that

t t t
ags+y=a(s [ S.ds— [ Stas) = Spar+as; [ Ss ds — S? dt =€dS;.

4. The time of exercise of an American call option must be a stopping time for the filtration (¥;).
The value of the option, if exercised at the stopping time t, is V; = (S; — K)T, and it follows by
the usual argument that the value at time 0 of the option exercised at t is Eg(e~”* Vr). Thus the
value at time 0 of the American option is sup, {Eg(e~"" Vz)}, where the supremum is taken over all
stopping times t satisfying P(t < T) = 1. Under the probability measure Q, the process e—”! V; is
a martingale, whence, by the optional stopping theorem, Eg(e~’* Vr} = Vo for all stopping times T.
The claim follows.

5. We rewrite the value at time 0 of the European call option, possibly with the aid of Exercise
(13.10.1), as

eTE( (Soexp{rT - 50°T +aVTN} -K)*) = E((Soexp{—30?T +o-VTN} —Ke~!?)*),

where N is an N(O, 1) random variable. It is immediate that this is increasing in Sp and r and is
decreasing in K. To show monotonicity in T, we argue as follows. Let T; < T> and consider the
European option with exercise date 7. In the corresponding American option we are allowed to
exercise the option at the earlier time T,. By Exercise (13.10.4), it is never better to stop earlier than
Tp, and the claim follows.

Monotonicity in ao may be shown by differentiation.
