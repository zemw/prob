[7.3.11]-[7.5.1] Exercises Convergence of random variables

0 if}), P(X1 > an) < ~,
1 if 0, P(X, > an) = ow.
11. Construct an example to show that the convergence in distribution of X, to X does not imply the
convergence of the unique medians of the sequence Xp.

(b) P(X > an io.) = {

12. (i) Let {X; : r > 1} be independent, non-negative and identically distributed with infinite mean.
Show that lim sup,_,,) X,/r = oo almost surely.
(ii) Let {X;} be a stationary Markov chain on the positive integers with transition probabilities
—— ifk=j+1,
j+2 J
— ifk=1.
j+2

(a) Find the stationary distribution of the chain, and show that it has infinite mean.
(b) Show that lim sup,_, 4 X,/r < 1 almost surely.

13. Let {X; : 1 <7 <n} be independent and identically distributed with mean yz and finite variance
o?. Let X =n—! S>"_, X;. Show that

do — w) /
r=1

converges in distribution to the N(0, 1) distribution as n — oo.

7.4 Exercise. Laws of large numbers

1. Let X2, X3,... be independent random variables such that

1

P(X, =n) = P(X, = —n) = wloen’

» PX, =0=1-

2n logn

Show that this sequence obeys the weak law but not the strong law, in the sense that n! VX:
converges to 0 in probability but not almost surely.

2. Construct a sequence {X; : r > 1} of independent random variables with zero mean such that
n—!yo"_| X, > —oo almost surely, as n > 00.

3. Let N be a spatial Poisson process with constant intensity 2 in R@, where d > 2. Let S be the
ball of radius r centred at zero. Show that N(S)/|S| — A almost surely as r > oo, where | S| is the
volume of the ball.

7.5 Exercises. The strong law

1. Entropy. The interval [0, 1] is partitioned into n disjoint sub-intervals with lengths p), po, ...,
Pn, and the entropy of this partition is defined to be
