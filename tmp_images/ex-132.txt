Problems Exercises [12.9.9]-[12.9.14]

Use the martingale convergence theorem to show that, if 0 < € < 1, then P(Z, — 0) = & and
P(Z, > wo) = 1-6.

9. Let (Y, F) be a non-negative martingale, and let ¥Y* = max{Y, : 0 < k <n}. Show that
e€
E(Y*) < 1 + E(¥p (log ¥n)*)}.

[Hint: alogt b < alogt a+ b/e if a, b > 0, where log* x = max{0, log x}.]

10. Let X = {X(t) : t > 0} be a birth-death process with parameters 4;, 4;, where 4; = 0 if and
only if i = 0. Define h(0) = 0, (1) = 1, and

Show that 4(X(t)) constitutes a martingale with respect to the filtration F; = o({X(u) :0 <u < t}),
whenever Eh(X(t)) < 00 for all t. (You may assume that the forward equations are satisfied.)

Fix n, and let m <n; let x(m) be the probability that the process is absorbed at 0 before it reaches
size n, having started at size m. Show that r(m) = 1 — {h(m)/h(n)}.

11. Let (Y, ¥) be a submartingale such that E(Y, +) < M for some M and all n.

(a) Show that M, = limm—oo EY? nim | Fn) exists (almost surely) and defines a martingale with
respect to F-

(b) Show that Y, may be expressed in the form Y, = Xy,— Zy» where (X, F) is a non-negative
martingale, and (Z, F) is a non-negative supermartingale. This representation of Y is sometimes
termed the ‘Krickeberg decomposition’.

(c) Let (Y, ¥) be a martingale such that E/Y,| < M for some M and all n. Show that Y may be
expressed as the difference of two non-negative martingales.

12. Let £Y, be the assets of an insurance company after n years of trading. During each year it
receives a total (fixed) income of £P in premiums. During the nth year it pays out a total of £Cy in
claims. Thus ¥,41 = Yn + P —C,41. Suppose that Cy, C2,... are independent N (uw, o”) variables
and show that the probability of ultimate bankruptcy satisfies
2(P — wy
P(Y, <0 for some n) < exp poor} .

13. Polya’s urn. A bag contains red and blue balls, with initially r red and b blue where rb > 0. A
ball is drawn from the bag, its colour noted, and then it is returned to the bag together with a new ball
of the same colour. Let Ry, be the number of red balls after n such operations.

(a) Show that Y, = Ry/(n +r +b) is a martingale which converges almost surely and in mean.
(b) Let T be the number of balls drawn until the first blue ball appears, and suppose that r = b = 1.
Show that E{(T + 2)~!} =

(c) Suppose r = b = 1, and show that P(Y, > ; for some n) < q

14. Here is a modification of the last problem. Let {Ay : n => 1} be a sequence of random variables,
each being a non-negative integer. We are provided with the bag of Problem (12.9.13), and we add
balls according to the following rules. At each stage a ball is drawn from the bag, and its colour noted;
we assume that the distribution of this colour depends only on the current contents of the bag and not
on any further information concerning the A,. We return this ball together with A, new balls of the
same colour. Write Ry, and B, for the numbers of red and blue balls in the urn after n operations, and
