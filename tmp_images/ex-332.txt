Convergence of random variables

7.1 Solutions. Introduction

1. (a) El(eX)"| = |cl” + {Xl}.

(b) This is Minkowski’s inequality.

(c) Let e > 0. Certainly |X| > Je where J, is the indicator function of the event {|X| > ¢}. Hence
E|X"| > EjlZ| = P(\X| > ©), implying that P(|X| > €) = 0 for all e > 0. The converse is trivial.
2. (a) E({aX + bY}Z) = aE(XZ) + DE(YZ).

(b) E(X + Y}?) + E({X — ¥}?) = 2E(X?) + 2E(¥?).

(c) Clearly

n 2 n
E {5} ) = S>E(X?) +25 - E(X;X)).

3. Let fu) = Ze, g(u) = 0, h(u) = —4e, for all u. Then de(f, g) + de(g,h) = 0 whereas
de(f,h) = 1.

4. Either argue directly, or as follows. With any distribution function F, we may associate a graph
F obtained by adding to the graph of F vertical line segments connecting the two endpoints at each
discontinuity of F. By drawing a picture, you may see that /2d(F, G) equals the maximum distance
between F and G measured along lines of slope —1. It is now clear that d(F, G) = 0 if and only if
F = G, and that d(F, G) = d(G, F). Finally, by the triangle inequality for real numbers, we have
that d(F, H) < d(F,G)+d(G, H).

5. Take X to be any random variable satisfying E(X 2) = oo, and define Xp = X for all n.

7.2 Solutions. Modes of convergence
1. (a) By Minkowski’s inequality,
{B|X" |} < {BX — XI} + CELXh I;
let n -> 00 to obtain lim infy—o9 E|X},| > E|X’"|. By another application of Minkowski’s inequality,
{E[X5|}/" < {EUXn — XI} + {B1X"

whence lim sup, _, 59 E|X},| < E|X"|.
