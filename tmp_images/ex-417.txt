[12.9.18]-[12.9.19] Solutions Martingales

the martingales (Un — Uo)? - na? and (Vn — Vo)? - nos (see equation (12.5.14) and Exercise (10.2.2))
that
E{(Ur — Up)"}=o7E(T), E{(Vr — Vo)”} = of E(Z).

Applying the same argument to (U, + Vi) — (Up + Vo), we obtain

E{(Up + Vr — Up — Vo)*} = ECTYE((X1 + Yy)7} = E(T)(0? 4+ 2c +09).
Subtract the two earlier equations to obtain
(*) E{(Ur — Up)(Vr — Vo)} = cE(T)

if E(T) < co. Now Ur Vy = 0, and in addition E(Ur) = Up, E(Vr) = Vo, by Wald’s equation and
the fact that E(X;) = E(Y;) = 0. It follows that -E(Up Vo) = cE(T) if E(T) < oe, in which case
c <0.

Suppose conversely that c < 0. Then (+) is valid with T replaced throughout by the bounded
stopping time T A m, and hence

0 < EUramVram) = E(UpVo) + cE(T Am).

Therefore E(T Am) < E(UgVo)/(2|c|) for all m, implying that E(T) = limm—oo E(T Am) < 00,
and so E(T) = —E(Ug Vo)/c as before.

18. Certainly 0 < X, < 1, and in addition X, is measurable with respect to the o-field Fy, =
o(R1, R,..., Rn). Also E(Ry41 | Rn) = Rn — Rn/(S2 — 1), whence E(Xn41 | Fn) = Xn.
Therefore X» is a martingale. ;

A strategy corresponds to a stopping time. If the player decides to call at the stopping time T, he
wins with (conditional) probability X7, and therefore P(wins) = E(X7), which equals E(X9) (= 5)
by the optional stopping theorem.

Here is a trivial solution to the problem. It may be seen that the chance of winning is the same
for a player who, after calling “Red Now”, picks the card placed at the bottom of the pack rather than
that at the top. The bottom card is red with probability 5 irrespective of the strategy of the player.

19, (a) Asums of money in week t is equivalent toasum s/(1+a)! in week 0, since the latter sum may
be invested now to yield s in week t. If he sells in week tf, his discounted costs are sv =j¢e/(i+a)”"
and his discounted profit is X;/(1 + a)‘. He wishes to find a stopping time for which his mean
discounted gain is a maximum.

Now

T
- Sr taye = “fa +a)? - 1},
n=l o

so that u(T) = E{(1 +a)~7 Zr} — (c/a).
(b) The function A(y) = ay — SS P(Zn > y)dy is continuous and strictly increasing on [0, 00),
with h(0) = —E(Z,) < 0 and h(yv) > co as y > oo. Therefore there exists a unique y (> 0) such
that h(y) = 0, and we choose y accordingly.
(c) Let Fy = 0 (Z1, Z2,..., Zn). We have that

oO

E(max(Zn, y}) = y +/ [1 -GQ)ldy = +.a)y
Y

where G(y) = P(Zn < y). Therefore E(V,41 | Fn) = 1 +a)""y < Vn, 8o that (Vn, Fn) is a
non-negative supermartingale.
