[7.11.6]-[7.11.13] Exercises Convergence of random variables

(a) Find the covariance of N(s) and N(t).

(b) Show that N is continuous in mean square, which is to say that E({N (t+h)-—N (t)}?) — Oas
h->0.

(c) Prove that N is continuous in probability, which is to say that P(|N (t+h)— N(t)| > €) — Oas
h — 0, for all ¢ > 0.

(d) Show that N is differentiable in probability but not in mean square.

6. Prove thatn—! 1 Xj +5; 0 whenever the X j are independent identically distributed variables
with zero means and such that E(X4) <M.

11. The sequence {X,} is said to be mean-square Cauchy convergent if E{(Xy — Xm)"} —> Oas
m,n — ov. Show that {X,} converges in mean square to some limit X if and only if it is mean-square
Cauchy convergent. Does the corresponding result hold for the other modes of convergence?

12. Suppose that {X,,} is a sequence of uncorrelated variables with zero means and uniformly bounded
variances. Show that n~! S07_, X; aS. 0.

13. Let X1, X2,... be independent identically distributed random variables with the common dis-
tribution function F, and suppose that F(x) < 1 for all x. Let My, = max{X 1, X2,..., Xn} and
suppose that there exists a strictly increasing unbounded positive sequence a,,a2,... such that
P(My/an <x) — H(x) for some distribution function H. Let us assume that H is continuous
with 0 < H(1) < 1; substantially weaker conditions suffice but introduce extra difficulties.

(a) Show that n[1 — F(ay,x)] ~ — log H() as n — o and deduce that
1— F(ay,x) . log H(x)
1— F(an) log H(i)

(b) Deduce that if x > 0
1— F(tx) log H(x)
