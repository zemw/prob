[5.5.1]-[5.6.5] Exercises Generating functions and their applications

5.5 Exercises. Age-dependent branching processes
1. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation in an age-dependent branching process Z(t), the lifetime

distribution of which is exponential with parameter A. If Z(0) = 1, show that the probability generating
function G;(s) of Z(t) satisfies

0
9 Ors) = A{G(Gi(s)) — Gr(s)}.

Show in the case of ‘exponential binary fission’, when G(s) = s”, that

—At

sé
OS) = Te)

and hence derive the probability mass function of the population size Z(r) at time tf.

2. Solve the differential equation of Exercise (1) when A = 1 and G(s) = (1 +s), to obtain

2s +t(1—s)

CS) = Saas)”

Hence find P(Z(t) => k), and deduce that

P(Z(t)/t >x|Z(t) > 0) ae ast > ow.

5.6 Exercises. Expectation revisited

1. Jensen’s inequality. A function u : R — R is called convex if for all real a there exists A,
depending ona, such that u(x) > u(a)+A(x—a) for all x. (Draw adiagram to illustrate this definition.)
Show that, if u is convex and X is a random variable with finite mean, then E(u(X)) > u(E(X)).

2. Let X,,X2,... be random variables satisfying E(} +72) |X;|) < 00. Show that
[oe] CO
B(> x) = SO E(X).
i=1 i=1

3. Let {X,} be a sequence of random variables satisfying X, < Y a.s. for some Y with E/Y| < o.
Show that

E (iim sup Xn) > lim sup E(Xy).
n> CO

A> CO
4. Suppose that E]X"| < oo where r > 0. Deduce that x” P(|X| = x) > 0as x — oo. Conversely,
suppose that x” P(|X| => x) — Oas x — oo where r > 0, and show that E|X*| < cofor0<s <r.

5. Show that E|X| < oo if and only if the following holds: for all « > 0, there exists 6 > 0, such
that E(|X|J4) < € for all A such that P(A) < 6.
