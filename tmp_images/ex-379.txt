Renewals

10.1 Solutions. The renewal equation

1. Since E(X,) > 0, there exists « (> 0) such that P(X; > €) > e. Let Xi = €l{x,>e}, and denote

by N’ the related renewal process. Now N(t) < N’(t), so that Ee°N®) < Be?" "Oy, for 6 > 0.
Let Z», be the number of renewals (in N’) between the times at which N’ reaches the values (m — 1)e

and me. The Z’s are independent with
ee®

whence E(e9N’"®) < (ce? {1 — (1 —e)e? yy for sufficiently small positive 6.

2. Let X, be the time of the first arrival. If X; > s, then W = 5. On the other hand if X; < s, then
the process starts off afresh at the new starting time X;. Therefore, by conditioning on the value of
Xi,

Fw) = [rw sx| Xi =warw = [pw sx-wdrwt [1-aFw
= [ Pov sx-warw+t- Fo)

ifx > s. Itis clear that Fy (x) = Oif x < s. This integral equation for Fy may be written in the
standard form

Fw(x) = H(x) +f Fw(x —u)dF(u)

where H and F are given by

may ={) ifx <s, Fay ={ oe ifx <s,
1-F(s) ifx>s, F(s) ifx>s.

This renewal-type equation may be solved in the usual way by the method of Laplace—Stieltjes trans-
forms. We have that Fy, = H* + FRF*, whence Fy, = H*/(1 — F*). If N is a Poisson process
then F(x) = 1 — e~*. In this case
OO
H*(@) = [ 2 dH (x) = eT At O8,

since H is constant apart from a jump at x = s. Similarly

F* (0) = ~8% g F(x) = —~(1 — e195),
