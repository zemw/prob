[(3.11.20]-[3.11.21] Solutions Discrete random variables

20. (a) Let each edge be blue with probability p; and yellow with probability po; assume these two
events are independent of each other and of the colourings of all other edges. Call an edge green if it
is both blue and yellow, so that each edge is green with probability p, p2. If there is a working green
connection from source to sink, then there is also a blue connection and a yellow connection. Thus

P(green connection) < P(blue connection, and yellow connection)
= P(blue connection)P(yellow connection)

so that R(p1 p2) < R(p1)R(p2).

(b) This is somewhat harder, and may be proved by induction on the number n of edges of G. Ifn = 1
then a consideration of the two possible cases yields that either R(p) = 1 for all p, or R(p) = p for
all p. In either case the required inequality holds.

Suppose then that the inequality is valid whenever n < k where k > 2, and consider the case
when G has k edges. Let e be an edge of G and write w(e) for the state of e; w(e) = 1 if e is working,
and w(e) = 0 otherwise. Writing A for the event that there is a working connection from source to
sink, we have that

R(p’) = Ppy (A | o(e) = 1) p” + Ppr (A | w(e) = 0)(1 — p”)
< Pp(A | o(e) = 1)" p” + Pp(A | w(e) = 0)" (1 — p”)
where Py is the appropriate probability measure when each edge is working with probability a. The

inequality here is valid since, if w(e) is given, then the network G is effectively reduced in size by one
edge; the induction hypothesis is then utilized for the case n = k — 1. Jt is a minor chore to check that

x¥ p¥ +y%(1—p)’ <{xp+yQ—p)}” — ifx > y = 0;

to see this, check that equality holds when x = y > 0 and that the derivative of the left-hand side with
respect to x is at most the corresponding derivative of the right-hand side when x, y > 0. Apply the
latter inequality with x = P,(A | w(e) = 1) and y = Pp(A | w(e) = 0) to obtain

R(p”) < {Pp(A | of) = Ip + Pp(A | o(e) = O(1 — p)}” = R(p)”.

21. (a) The number X of such extraordinary individuals has the bin(107, 1077) distribution. Hence
