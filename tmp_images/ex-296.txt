Chains with finitely many states Solutions [6.5.7]-[6.6.2]

7. A simple random walk which moves rightwards with probability p has a stationary measure
ttn = A(p/q)", in the sense that m is a vector satisfying x = mP. It is not necessarily the case that
this 7 has finite sum. It may then be checked that the recipe given in the solution to Exercise (6.5.3)
yields x(i, j) = pi p3 / 07,s)eC P| P2 as stationary distribution for the given process, where C is the
relevant region of the plane, and p; = p;/gq; and p; (= 1 — q;) is the chance that the ith walk moves
rightwards on any given step.

8. Since the chain is irreducible with a finite state space, we have that z; > 0 for all i. Assume the
chain is reversible. The balance equations 7; pjj = 7; Pji give pi; = 7; Pji/nji. Let D be the matrix
with entries 1/7; on the diagonal, and § the matrix (7; p;;), and check that P = DS.

Conversely, if P = DS, then d;} Pij = a7! Pji, whence 7; = d;} / de | satisfies the detailed

balance equations.

Note that
If the chain is reversible in equilibrium, the matrix M = (, [1 |; Di i) is symmetric, and therefore M,
and, by the above, P, has real eigenvalues. An example of the failure of the converse is the transition
matrix

which has real eigenvalues 1, and -4 (twice), and stationary distribution z = g, g, 5)- However,

m1 pi3=O0F 5 = 703 p31, so that such a chain is not reversible.

9. Simply check the detailed balance equations 7; pjj = 7; Pji-

1. Let P = (pj : 1 < i, j < n) bea stochastic matrix and let C be the subset of R” containing
all vectors x = (x1, %2,...,Xn) satisfying x; > O for all i and we x; = 1; for x e€ C, let
[|x|] = max, {x;}. Define the linear mapping T : C > R” by T(x) = xP. Let us check that T is a
continuous function from C into C. First,

IT()|| = max 9 Pi} < a||x|

where
a = max > pi}

hence ||7(x) — T(y)|| < @ |x — yl]. Secondly, T(x); = 0 for all j, and

j ji i J

Applying the given theorem, there exists a point w in C such that T (@) = 2, which is to say that
n=aHP.

2. Let P bea stochastic m x m matrix and let T be the m x (m + 1) matrix with (i, j)th entry

f= { piy — 9: if j <m,
