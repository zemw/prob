(3.11.7]-[3.11.14] Exercises Discrete random variables

7. If X is geometric, show that P(X =n+k |X > n) = P(X =&) fork, n > 1. Why do you think
that this is called the ‘lack of memory’ property? Does any other distribution on the positive integers
have this property?

8. Show that the sum of two independent binomial variables, bin(m, p) and bin(n, p) respectively,
is bin(m +n, p).

9. Let N be the number of heads occurring inn tosses of a biased coin. Write down the mass function
of N in terms of the probability p of heads turning up on each toss. Prove and utilize the identity

» (3) =3{@ ty" +0-2)"}

in order to calculate the probability p, that N is even. Compare with Problem (1.8.20).

10. Anurn contains N balls, b of which are blue and r (= N — b) of which are red. A random sample
of n balls is withdrawn without replacement from the urn. Show that the number B of blue balls in
this sample has the mass function

men ()(09/()

This is called the hypergeometric distribution with parameters N, b, and n. Show further that if N, b,
and r approach oo in such a way that b/N — p andr/N — 1 — p, then

P(B =k > (7) pea — pyr.

You have shown that, for small n and large N, the distribution of B barely depends on whether or not
the balls are replaced in the urn immediately after their withdrawal.

11, Let X and Y be independent bin(n, p) variables, and let Z = X + Y. Show that the conditional
distribution of X given Z = N is the hypergeometric distribution of Problem (3.11.10).

12. Suppose X and Y take values in {0, 1}, with joint mass function f(x, y). Write f(0,0) = a,
fO, 1) = b, fA, 0) =c, fU, ) = d, and find necessary and sufficient conditions for X and Y to
be: (a) uncorrelated, (b) independent.

13. (a) If X takes non-negative integer values show that
io.¢]
E(X) = 5) P(X > n).
=0

(b) An urn contains b blue and r red balls. Balls are removed at random until the first blue ball is
drawn. Show that the expected number drawn is (b +r 4+ 1)/(b4+ 1).

(c) The balls are replaced and then removed at random until all the remaining balls are of the same
colour. Find the expected number remaining in the urn.

14. Let X,, X2,..., Xn be independent random variables, and suppose that X; is Bernoulli with
parameter py. Show that Y = X,; + X2 +--+-+ Xn has mean and variance given by

E(Y)= >> pe, var(¥) = >> pe(1 — pr).
