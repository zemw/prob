43. The coordinates (X;, Y;, Zj), 1 <i <3, of three points A, B, C are independent N(0, 1). Show

that the probability that C lies inside the sphere with diameter AB is : - aes

44, Skewness. Let X have variance o” and write m, = E(X*). Define the skewness of X by

skw(X) = E[(X — m1)*]/o3. Show that:

(a) skw(X) = (m3 — 3mym2 + 2m})/o3,

(b) skw(S,) = skw(X1)/./n, where S;, = ey X; is a sum of independent identically distributed
random variables,

(c) skw(X) = (1 —2p)/,/npq, when X is bin(n, p) where p+ q = 1,

(d) skw(X) = 1/ Ji, when X is Poisson with parameter A,

(e) skw(X) = 2/./t, when X is gamma I'(A, t), and ¢ is integral.

45. Kurtosis. Let X have variance o” and E(X*) = mx. Define the kurtosis of X by kur(X) =

E[(X — m,)*]/o*+. Show that:

(a) kur(X) = 3, when X is N(, 7),

(b) kur(X) = 9, when X is exponential with parameter A,

(c) kur(X) = 3+ 271, when X is Poisson with parameter A,

(d) kur(S,) = 3 + {kur(X1) — 3}/n, where Sy, = ye X, is a sum of independent identically
distributed random variables.

46. Extreme value. Fisher-Gumbel-Tippett distribution. Let X,, 1 <r <n, be independent and
exponentially distributed with parameter 1. Show that X(,) = max{X, :1 <r <n} satisfies

. _ _ a
im, PX a) logn < x) = exp(—e“).

Hence show that Io” {1 — exp(—e~*)} dx = y where y is Euler’s constant.

47. Squeezing. Let S and X have density functions satisfying b(x) < fs(x) < a(x) and fs(x) <
fx(). Let U be uniformly distributed on [0, 1] and independent of X. Given the value X, we
implement the following algorithm:

if Ufx(X) > a(X), reject X;
otherwise: if Ufy(X) < b(X), — accept X;
otherwise: if Ufy(X) < fs(X), accept X;
otherwise: reject X.

Show that, conditional on ultimate acceptance, X is distributed as $. Explain when you might use this
method of sampling.

48. Let X, Y, and {U; : r = 1} be independent random variables, where:

P(X =x) =(e-le*, PY = y= yore yah,

and the U; are uniform on [0,1]. Let 4 = max{U,, U2,..., Uy}, and show that Z = X — M is
exponentially distributed.

49. Let U and V be independent and uniform on [0, 1]. Set X = —a7! log U and Y = —logV
where a > 0.
