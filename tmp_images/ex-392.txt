M/M/1 Solutions [11.2.4]-[11.2.7]

This is the characteristic function of the given distribution. The atom at 0 corresponds to the possibility
that Q = 0.

4. We prove this by induction on the value of i + j. Ifi + 7 =O theni = j = 0, and it is easy to
check that 7(0; 0,0) = 1 and A(O; 0,0) = 1, A(@m; 0,0) = O for n > 1. Suppose then that K > 1,
and that the claim is valid for all pairs (i, j) satisfying i+ j = K. Leti and j satisfyi+ j = K +1.
The last ball picked has probability i/(i + j) of being red; conditioning on the colour of the last ball,
we have that . .

Substitute to obtain the required answer, after a little cancellation and collection of terms. Can you
see a more natural way?

5. Let Aand B be independent Poisson process with intensities A and 1 respectively. These processes
generate a queue-process as follows. At each arrival time of A, a customer arrives in the shop. At
each arrival-time of B, the customer being served completes his service and leaves; if the queue
is empty at this moment, then nothing happens. It is not difficult to see that this queue-process is
M(A)/M(y)/1. Suppose that A(t) = i and B(t) = j. During the time-interval [0, ¢], the order of
arrivals and departures follows the schedule of Exercise (11.2.4), arrivals being marked as red balls
and departures as lemon balls. The imbedded chain has the same distributions as the random walk
of that exercise, and it follows that P(Q(t) = n | A(t) = i, B(t) = j) = x(n; i, j). Therefore
Pn(t) = 0, ; Hi, PPAO =D)PBO = J).
6. With p =A/w, the stationary distribution of the imbedded chain is, as in Exercise (11.2.1),

. {8 ifn =0,

In the usual notation of continuous-time Markov chains, g9 = A and g, = 1+ yw forn > 1, whence,

by Exercise (6.10.11), there exists a constant c such that
Cc

Now 5°; 7; = 1, and therefore c = 2A and mp = (1 — p)e” as required. The working is reversible.

7. (a) Let Q;(t) be the number of people in the ith queue at time f, including any currently in service.
The process Q, is reversible in equilibrium, and departures in the original process correspond to arrivals
in the reversed process. It follows that the departure process of the first queue is a Poisson process
with intensity 2, and that the departure process of Q is independent of the current value of Q .

(b) We have from part (a) that, for any given ft, the random variables Q;(t), Q2(t) are independent.
Consider an arriving customer when the queues are in equilibrium, and let W; be his waiting time
(before service) in the ith queue. With T the time of arrival, and recalling Exercise (11.2.3),

P(W, = 0, Wz = 0) > P(Q;(T) = O fori = 1,2) = P(Qi(T) = 0)P(Q2(T) = 0)
= (1 — p1)(1 — 92) = PCW; = 0)P(W2 = 0).
Therefore W; and W2 are not independent. There is a slight complication arising from the fact that T

is arandom variable. However, T is independent of everybody who has gone before, and in particular
of the earlier values of the queue processes Q;.
