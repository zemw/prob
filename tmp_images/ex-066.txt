1. A fair coin is tossed n times, showing heads H,, times and tails T, times. Let S, = Hy — Thy.
Show that 1

3. Show that the moment generating function of X is finite in a neighbourhood of the origin if and
only if X has exponentially decaying tails, in the sense that there exist positive constants A and yz such
that P(|X| > a) < ye for a > 0. [Seen in the light of this observation, the condition of the large
deviation theorem (5.11.4) is very natural].

4. Let X1, X2,... be independent random variables having the Cauchy distribution, and let S$, =
XytXot+---+ Xp. Find P(S, > an).

5.12 Problems

1. A die is thrown ten times. What is the probability that the sum of the scores is 27?

2. Acoin is tossed repeatedly, heads appearing with probability p on each toss.

(a) Let X be the number of tosses until the first occasion by which three heads have appeared
successively. Write down a difference equation for f(k) = P(X = k) and solve it. Now write
down an equation for E(X) using conditional expectation. (Try the same thing for the first
occurrence of HTH).

(b) Let N be the number of heads in n tosses of the coin. Write down Gy(s). Hence find the
probability that: (i) N is divisible by 2, (ii) N is divisible by 3.

3. Accoin is tossed repeatedly, heads occurring on each toss with probability p. Find the probability

generating function of the number T of tosses before a run of n heads has appeared for the first time.

4. Find the generating function of the negative binomial mass function
