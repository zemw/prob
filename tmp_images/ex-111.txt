[9.2.2]-[9.4.2] Exercises Stationary processes

(ii) Find an expression for D = E{(Xn41 — Xn41)2} — E{(Xn41 — Xn41)7}, and evaluate this
expression when:
(a) X, = cos(nU) where U is uniform on [—2, x],
(b) X is an autoregressive scheme with c(k) = o:!*l where ja] < 1.

2. Suppose |a| < 1. Does there exist a (weakly) stationary sequence {X, : —oo <n < oo} with
zero means and autocovariance function

1 ifk =0,

(k) = Cif [kl =1
Cc = L+a2 =t,
0 if |k| > 1.

Assuming that such a sequence exists, find the best linear predictor Xn of X», given X,-1,
Xy—-2,---, and show that the mean squared error of prediction is (1 + a*)—!_ Verify that {Xp} is
(weakly) stationary.

9.3 Exercises. Autocovariances and spectra

1. Let X, = Acos(nd) + Bsin(nd) where A and B are uncorrelated random variables with zero
means and unit variances. Show that X is stationary with a spectrum containing exactly one point.

2. Let U be uniformly distributed on (—7, 2), and let V be independent of U with distribution func-
tion F. Show that X, = e!(U—Y") defines a stationary (complex) sequence with spectral distribution
function F’.

3. Find the autocorrelation function of the stationary process {X(t) : —oo <t < oo} whose spectral
density function is:

@ N,V, i) f(x) = Fe7 FI, -00 < x < 00.

4. Let X,, X2,... beareal-valued stationary sequence with zero means and autocovariance function

9.4 Exercises. Stochastic integration and the spectral representation
1. Let S be the spectral process of a stationary process X with zero mean and unit variance. Show
that the increments of S have zero means.

2. Moving average representation. Let X be a discrete-time stationary process having zero means,
continuous strictly positive spectral density function f, and with spectral process S. Let
