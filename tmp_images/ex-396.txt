Problems Solutions [11.7.3]-[11.8.1]

3. (a) We may take as state space the set {0, 1’, 1”,2,3,...}, where i € {0,2,3,...} is the state
of having i people in the system including any currently in service, and 1’ (respectively 1’) is the
state of having exactly one person in the system, this person being served by the first (respectively
second) server. It is straightforward to check that this process is reversible in equilibrium, whence the
departure process is as stated, by the argument used in Exercise (11.2.7).

(b) This time, we take as state space the set {0’, 0”, 1’, 1”, 2,3, ... } having the same states as in part
(a) with the difference that 0’ (respectively 0”) is the state in which there are no customers present and
the first (respectively second) server has been free for the shorter time. It is easily seen that transition
from 0’ to 1” has strictly positive probability whereas transition from 1” to 0’ has zero probability,
implying that the process is not reversible. By drawing a diagram of the state space, or otherwise, it
may be seen that the time-reversal of the process has the same structure as the original, with the unique
change that states 0’ are 0” are interchanged. Since departures in the original process correspond to
arrivals in the time-reversal, the required properties follow in the same manner as in Exercise (11.2.7).

4, The total time spent by a given customer in service may be expressed as the sum of geometrically
distributed number of exponential random variables, and this is easily shown to be exponential with
parameter 52. The queue is therefore in effect a M(A)/M(64)/1 system, and the stationary distribution
is the geometric distribution with parameter p = A/(52), provided p < 1. As in Exercise (11.2.7),
the process of departures is Poisson.

Assume that rejoining customers go to the end of the queue, and note that the number of customers

present constitutes a Markov chain. However, the composite process of arrivals is not Poisson, since
increments are no longer independent. This may be seen as follows. In equilibrium, the probability of
an arrival of either kind during the time interval (¢, f+) isAh+ pul -dh+o(h) = A/d)A+0(h).
If there were an arrival of either kind during (¢ — h, t), then (with conditional probability 1 — O(/))
the queue is non-empty at time t, whence the conditional probability of an arrival of either kind during
(t,t +h) is Ah + w(1 — 5)h + O(h); this is of a larger order of magnitude than the earlier probability
(A/d)h + o(h).
5. For stations r,s, we write r > s if an individual at r visits s at a later time with a strictly positive
probability. Let C comprise the station j together with all stations i such that i > j. The process
restricted to C is an open migration process in equilibrium. By Theorem (11.7.19), the restricted
process is reversible, whence the process of departures from C via j is a Poisson process with some
intensity ¢. Individuals departing C via j proceed directly to k with probability

independently of the number n; of individuals currently at j. Such a thinned Poisson process is a
Poisson process also (cf. Exercise (6.8.2)), and the claim follows.
