is the joint generating function of four variables that are pairwise and triplewise independent, but are
nevertheless not independent.

9. Let G, and G2 be probability generating functions, and suppose that 0 < a < 1. Show that
G G2, and aG, + (1 — @)Gz are probability generating functions. Is G(as)/G(a@) necessarily a
probability generating function?

1. Let X be the number of events in the sequence A 1, A2,..., An which occur. Let Sy = E(*),
the mean value of the random binomial coefficient (x ), and show that

2. Each person in a group of n people chooses another at random. Find the probability:
(a) that exactly k people are chosen by nobody,
(b) that at least k people are chosen by nobody.

3. Compounding.

(a) Let X have the Poisson distribution with parameter Y, where Y has the Poisson distribution with
parameter 4. Show that Gy ,y(x) = exp{y(xe*—! —1)}.

(b) Let X1, X2,... be independent identically distributed random variables with the logarithmic
mass function k

(1 — p) >

klog(1/p)

where 0 < p < 1. If N is independent of the X; and has the Poisson distribution with parameter

Find the limit of this expression as n — oo and p — 0, the limit being taken in such a way that
np — dA where 0 < A < oo. Comment.

5. A coin is tossed repeatedly, and heads turns up with probability p on each toss. Let hy be
the probability of an even number of heads in the first n tosses, with the convention that 0 is an
even number. Find a difference equation for the hy and deduce that they have generating function
