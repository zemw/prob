[10.6.13]-[10.6.16] Solutions Renewals

Therefore m?* = F% 4 m*F%, Alsom* = F* + m* F*, so that

1-— F*

whence m** = F4* + m4* F*, the transform of the given integral equation.
(ii) Arguing as in Problem (10.6.2), v'* = F%*+2m* Fo +0* F% where v* = F*(1+2m*)/(1- F*)

is the corresponding object in the ordinary renewal process. We eliminate v* to find that

F%% (1 4+ 2m*
yt — aoe —— ) = m®*(1 4 2m*)

by («). Now invert.

13. Taking into account the structure of the process, it suffices to deal with the case J = 1. Refer
to Example (10.4.22) for the basic notation and analysis. It is easily seen that B = (v — 1)A. Now
F(t) =1—e—!. Solve the renewal equation (10.4.24) to obtain

t
g(t) = h(t) + | h(t — x) dii(x)

where m(x) = vAx is the renewal function associated with the interarrival time distribution F.
Therefore g(t) = 1, and m(t) = ef,

14, We have from Lemma (10.4.5) that p* = 1— F> + p*F*, where F* = Fy F3. Solve to obtain

15. The first locked period begins at the time of arrival of the first particle. Since all future events
may be timed relative to this arrival time, we may take this time to be 0. We shall therefore assume
that a particle arrives at 0; call this the Oth particle, with locking time Yo.

We shall condition on the time X, of the arrival of the next particle. Now

P(¥o > t) ifu >t,

PL > tix = ={ ; .
P(Yo > wWP(L'>t—u) ifu<t,

where L’ has the same distribution as L; the second part is a consequence of the fact that the process
‘restarts’ at each arrival. Therefore

t
PIL >t) = (1-G@) P(X, > +f P(L >t —u)(1— GW)) fx, @) du,
0

the required integral equation.

If G(x) = 1 — e~#*, the solution is P(L > t) = e~“, so that L has the same distribution as
the locking times of individual particles. This striking fact may be attributed to the lack-of-memory
property of the exponential distribution.

16. (a) It is clear that M(tp) is a renewal process whose interarrival times are distributed as X; +
Xo+---+XpR where P(R =r) = pq! forr > 1. It follows that M(t) is a renewal process whose
first interarrival time

X(p) =inf{t : M(t) = 1} = p inf{t : M(tp) = 1}
