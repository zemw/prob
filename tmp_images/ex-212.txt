Distributions arising from the normal distribution Solutions [4.10.2}-[4.10.6]

by the substitution u = x/z, where c is a constant. Hence g(z) = clzzmtn)-1,— 32 for z > 0, for
an appropriate constant c’, as required.

Second method. If m and n are integral, the following argument is neat. Let Z1, Zo,..., Zm4n be
independent N(0, 1) variables. Then X1 has the same distribution as Z} + Z ++--+ Z2,, and X2
the same distribution as Z?,, | + Z2,.,5 +--+ +Z24, (see Problem (4.14.12)). Hence X1 + Xz has
the same distribution as Z{ -+---+ Z2,,,, Le., the x2(m +2) distribution.

2. (i) The ¢(r) distribution is symmetric with finite mean, and hence this mean is 0.
(ii) Here is one way. Let U and V be independent x2(r) and x28) variables (respectively). Then

U/r _ s -1

if s > 2, since the integrand is a density function. Hence

E Ulr -— if s > 2.

(ii) If s < 2 then E(V—!) = 00.
3. Substitute r = 1 into the ¢(r) density function.

4, First method. Find the density function of X/Y, using a change of variables. The answer is
F(2, 2).

Second method. X and Y are independent x2(2) variables (just check the density functions), and
hence X/Y is F(2, 2).

5. The vector (X, X; — X, Xz — X,..., Xn — X) has, by Theorem (4.9.6), a multivariate normal
distribution. We have as in Exercise (4.5.7) that cov(X, X, — ¥) = 0 for all r, which implies that X¥
is independent of each X;. Using the form of the multivariate normal density function, it follows that
X is independent of the family {X, — X : 1 < r <n}, and hence of any function of these variables.
Now S? = (n — 1)—! 0. (X; — X)? is such a function.

6. The choice of fixed vector is immaterial, since the joint distribution of the X; is spherically
symmetric, and we therefore take this vector to be (0, 0,... ,0, 1). We make the change of variables
U? = Q? + X?2, tanW = Q/Xn, where Q? = S-"~} xX? and Q > 0. Since Q has the x?(n — 1)
distribution, and is independent of Xy, the pair Q, X», has joint density function

The theory is now slightly easier than the practice. We solve for U, VY, find the Jacobian, and deduce
the joint density function fy w(u, ¥) of U, YW. We now integrate over u, and choose the constant so
that the total integral is 1.
