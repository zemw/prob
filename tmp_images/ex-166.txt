Problems Solutions [2.7.15]-[2.7.20]

15. Suppose that, for some i # j, we have p; < p; and B; is to the left of B;. Write m for the
position of B; and r for the position of B;, and consider the effect of interchanging B; and B;. For
k<mandk > r,P(T > k) is unchanged by the move. Form < k <r, P(T > k) is decreased by an
amount p; — p;, since this is the increased probability that the search is successful at the mth position.
Therefore the interchange of B; and B; is desirable.

It follows that the only ordering in which P(T = k) can be reduced for no k is that ordering in
which the books appear in decreasing order of probability. In the event of ties, it is of no importance
how the tied books are placed.

16. Intuitively, it may seem better to go first since the first person has greater choice. This conclusion
is in fact false. Denote the coins by C, C2, C3 in order, and suppose you go second. If your opponent

chooses C; then you choose C3, because P(C3 beats Cy) = 2 + z . 3 = 38 > 5}. Likewise

P(C, beats Cz) = P(C> beats C3) = 3 > 5. Whichever coin your opponent picks, you can arrange
to have a better than evens chance of winning.

17. Various difficulties arise in sequential decision theory, even in simple problems such as this one.
The following simple argument yields the optimal policy. Suppose that you have made a unsuccessful
searches “ahead” and b unsuccessful searches “behind” (if any of these searches were successful, then
there is no further problem). Let A be the event that the correct direction is ahead. Then

P(current knowledge | A)P(A)
P(current knowledge)
_ (1 — p)*a
~ (l= p)ta+ (1 = phd - a)’

P(A [ current knowledge) =

which exceeds 5 if and only if (1 — p)*a > (1 - py? (i — a). The optimal policy is to compare
(1 — p)*a with (1 — py? (1 — a). You search ahead if the former is larger and behind otherwise; in
the event of a tie, do either.

18. (a) There are (S$) possible layouts, of which 8+8+2 are linear. The answer is 18/ - ).

(b) Each row and column must contain exactly one pawn. There are 8 possible positions in the first
row. Having chosen which of these is occupied, there are 7 positions in the second row which are

admissible, 6 in the third, and so one. The answer is 8!/ (S').

19, (a) The density function is f(x) = F’(x) = 2x e7*”, x>0.
(b) The density function is f(x) = F’(x) = x2e7!/*, x > 0.
(c) The density function is f(x) = F’(x) = 2(e* + e7*)72, xeéER.
(d) This is not a distribution function because F’(1) < 0.
20. We have that
PU = y= f fu,v(u, v)dudv =0.
{(u,v):u=v}

The random variables X, Y are continuous but not jointly continuous: there exists no integrable
function f : [0, 17 — R such that

x Py
rx sx. ¥sy)= [ / ft,v)dudv, O<x,y<1.
u=0 /v=0
