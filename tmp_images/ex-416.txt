Problems Solutions [12.9.14]-[12.9.17]

14. As in the previous solution, with $n the o-field generated by A,, Ao, ... and Fn,

E(Y, =

Yn,

sothatE(Yn41 | Fn) = E{E(¥n+41 | $n) | Fn} = Yn. Also|¥n| < 1, and therefore Y, is a martingale.
We need to show that P(T < 00) = 1. Let I, be the indicator function of the event {T > n}. We
have by conditioning on the A, that

E(In | A) = 1- a 1-
ns 2+ Sj je 245;

j=

asn —> 00, where Sj = al Aj. The infinite product equals 0 a.s. if and only if Li (2+ sj)! = 00
a.s. By monotone convergence, P(T < 00) = 1 under this condition. If this holds, we may apply the
optional stopping theorem to obtain that E(Y7) = E(Yo), which is to say that

15. At each stage k, let Lx be the length of the sequence ‘in play’, and let Y; be the sum of its
entries, so that Lp = n, Yo = ye x;. If you lose the (k + 1)th gamble, then Ly4; = Lx + 1 and
Ypiy = Ye + Z, where Zx is the stake on that play, whereas if you win, then Lyi, = Lx — 2 and
Yei1 = Ye — Zp; we have assumed that Ly > 2, similar relations being valid if Lz; = 1. Note that
Lz is arandom walk with mean step size — 1, implying that the first-passage time T to 0 is a.s. finite,
and has all moments finite. Your profits at time k amount to Yo — Yx, whence your profit at time T is
Yo, since Yr = 0.

Since the games are fair, Y; constitutes a martingale. Therefore E(Y¥7~jm) = E(Y¥) # 0 for
all m. However TA m — T as. asm — oo, so that Yr~m — Yr as. Now E(¥7) = 0 4
limm—+oo E(¥ram), and it follows that {¥r,jm : m > 1} is not uniformly integrable. Therefore
E(sup,;, YT Am) = 00; see Exercise (7.10.6).

16. Since the game is fair, E(Sp41 | Sn) = Sn. Also |S,| < 1+2+4---+n < oo. Therefore S, is
a martingale. The occurrence of the event {N = n} depends only on the outcomes of the coin-tosses
up to and including the nth; therefore N is a stopping time.

A tail appeared at time N — 3, followed by three heads. Therefore the gamblers G,, G2,...,
Gy_3 have forfeited their initial capital by time N, while Gy_j; has had i + 1 successful rounds for
0 <i <2. Therefore Sy =N—(p—!+ p e+ p?), after a little calculation. It is easy to check that
N satisfies the conditions of the optional stopping theorem, and it follows that E(Sy) = E(So) = 9,
which is to say that E(N) = p—! + p72 + po.

In order to deal with HTH, the gamblers are re-programmed to act as follows. If they win
on their first bet, they bet their current fortune on fails, returning to heads thereafter. In this case,
Sy = N- (p7! + p?q7}) where g = 1 — p (remember that the game is fair), and therefore
E(N) = p+ pq".

17. Let Fy = o({Xi, ¥; : 1 < i < n}), and note that T is a stopping time with respect to this
filtration. Furthermore P(T < co) = | since T is no larger than the first-passage time to 0 of either
of the two single-coordinate random walks, each of which has mean 0 and is therefore persistent.

Let of = var(X,) and af = var(Y,). We have that U, — Up and V, — Vo are sums of
independent summands with means 0 and variances a? and of respectively. It follows by considering
