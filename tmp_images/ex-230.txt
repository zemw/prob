Problems Solutions [4.14.35]-[4.14.37]

It follows that L; = — log F(X;), 1 <i <n, isasequence of independent variables with the expo-
nential distribution. The order statistics L(y), ..., L(,) are in order — log F(X(n)), ..., — log F(X),
since the function — log F(-) is non-increasing. Applying the result of Problem (4.14.33), Ey =
—n log F(X my) and

Erp =—-(a+1- r) {log F(X(n41-r) — log F(X(n42-r))}> l<r<n,

are independent with the exponential distribution. Therefore exp(—£,), 1 <r <n, are independent
with the uniform distribution.

35. One may be said to be in state j if the first 7 — 1 prizes have been rejected and the jth prize has
just been viewed. There are two possible decisions at this stage: accept the jth prize if it is the best
so far (there is no point in accepting it if it is not), or reject it and continue. The mean return of the
first decision equals the probability j/n that the jth prize is the best so far, and the mean return of the
second is the maximal probability f(j) that one may obtain the best prize having rejected the first /.
Thus the maximal mean return V(j) in state j satisfies

VQ) = max{j/n, f(/)).

Now j/n increases with j, and f(j) decreases with j (since a possible stategy is to reject the (j + 1)th
prize also). Therefore there exists J such that j/n < f(j) if and only if 7 < J. This confirms the
optimal stategy as having the following form: reject the first J prizes out of hand, and accept the
subsequent prize which is the best of those viewed so far. If there is no such prize, we pick the last
prize presented.

Let I; be the probability of achieving the best prize by following the above strategy. Let Az be
the event that you pick the kth prize, and B the event that the prize picked is the best. Then,

and we choose the integer J which maximizes this expresion.

When n is large, we have the asymptotic relation Ty ~ (J/n)log(n/J). The maximum of the
function hy(x) = (x/n) log(n/x) occurs at x = n/e, and we deduce that J ~ n/e. [A version of this
problem was posed by Cayley in 1875. Our solution is due to Lindley (1961).]

36. The joint density function of (X, Y, Z) is

fQ,y,2) = exp{—$(r? — 2ax — Quy — 2vz+4* +? +-v?)}

1
(2x07)3/2

where r2 = x* + y* + z*. The conditional density of X, Y, Z given R = r is therefore proportional
to exp{Ax + zy + vz}. Now choosing spherical polar coordinates with axis in the direction (A, 2, v),

we obtain a density function proportional to exp(acos@) sin@, where a = r\/A24+ p24 v2. The
constant is chosen in such a way that the total probability is unity.

37. (a) ¢'(x) = —x¢(x), so Hi (x) = x. Differentiate the equation for Hy, to obtain H,41 (x) =
xHpy(x) — H/(x), and use induction to deduce that Hy, is a polynomial of degree n as required.
