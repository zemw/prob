Random walk: counting sample paths Solutions [3.9.3]-[3.10.3]

3. The recurrence relation may be established as in Exercise (2). Set uy = (p* _ p’ )J;, and use
the fact that pz = (p* - eXy/ — ep) where p = q/p, to obtain

pugs — (1 —r)ug + quy_1 = e% — p*.

The solution is
k(ok + p)
P-q -
for constants A and B. The boundary conditions, uo = uy = 0, yield the answer.

ug = A+ Bok +

4. Conditioning in the obvious way on the result of the first toss, we obtain

Pmn = PPm—1,n + (1 — P)Pmn-1; ifm,n > 1.
The boundary conditions are pmo = 0, pon = 1. if m,n > 1.
5. Let Y be the number of negative steps of the walk up to absorption. Then E(X + Y) = D, and
y-Y= { N—k_ if the walk is absorbed at N,
—k if the walk is absorbed at 0.
Hence E(X — Y) = (N — k)(1 — pg) — kpx, and solving for EX gives the result.

3.10 Solutions. Random walk: counting sample paths

1. Conditioning on the first step X1,
P(T =2n) = 4P(T = 2n| X= 1) + 5P(T = 2n| X; =—-1)
= 4 f-12n—-1) +3 f1(2n -1)

where f,(m) is the probability that the first passage to b of a symmetric walk, starting from 0, takes
place at time m. From the hitting time theorem (3.10.14),

1 1 2n—1
fiQn —1) = f.yQn—-1) = P(Sn—1 = 1) = NTE \a-@a-D),
2n—1 2n—1 n

which therefore is the value of P(T = 2n).
For the last part, note first that “TP P(T = 2n) = 1, which is to say that P(T < oo) = 1; either
appeal to your favourite method in order to see this, or observe that P(T = 2n) is the coefficient of

s?” in the expansion of F(s) = 1— V1 —s2. The required result is easily obtained by expanding the
binomial coefficient using Stirling’s formula.
2. By equation (3.10.13) of PRP, for r > 0,
P(Mn =r) = P(My =r) —P(Mn > +)
= 2P(Sn =>r+1+P(Sp =r) — 2P(Sp, =r +2) —P(S, =r +1)
= P(Sy, =r) +P(Sp =r+ 1)
= max{P(Sp =r), P(Sn =r + 1}
since only one of these two terms is non-zero.

3. By considering the random walk reversed, we see that the probability of a first visit to Sz, at time
2k is the same as the probability of a last visit to Sp at time 2n — 2k. The result is then immediate
from the arc sine law (3.10.19) for the last visit to the origin.
