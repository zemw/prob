Problems Exercises [13.12.19]-[13.12.24]

19. Arc sine laws. For the standard Wiener process W, let A be the amount of time u during the
time interval [0, t] for which W(u) > 0; let L be the time of the last visit to the origin before ¢;
and let R be the time when W attains its maximum in [0, t]. Show that A, L, and R have the same
distribution function F(x) = (2/7) sin—! /x/f for 0 < x < +t. [Hint: Use the results of Problems
(13.12.15)-(13.12.18).]

20. Let W be a standard Wiener process, and let Ux be the amount of time spent below the level x
(= 0) during the time interval (0, 1), that is, U, = fo Tew a)<xj dt. Show that Ux has density function

21. Let sign(x) = 1 if x > Oand sign(x) = —1 otherwise. Show that V; = fo sign(Ws) dWs defines
a standard Wiener process if W is itself such a process.

22. After the level of an industrial process has been set at its desired value, it wanders in a random
fashion. To counteract this the process is periodically reset to this desired value, at times 0, T, 2T,....
If W, is the deviation from the desired level, ¢ units of time after a reset, then {W; :O0 <t < T} can
be modelled by a standard Wiener process. The behaviour of the process after a reset is independent
of its behaviour before the reset. While W; is outside the range (—a, a) the output from the process
is unsatisfactory and a cost is incurred at rate C per unit time. The cost of each reset is R. Show that
the period T which minimises the long-run average cost per unit time is T*, where

23. An economy is governed by the Black-Scholes model in which the stock price behaves as a
geometric Brownian motion with volatility o, and there is a constant interest rate r. An investor likes
to have a constant proportion y (€ (0, 1)) of the current value of her self-financing portfolio in stock
and the remainder in the bond. Show that the value function of her portfolio has the form V; = f(t)S, y

where f(t) = cexp{(1 — yy(gvo? + r)t} for some constant c depending on her initial wealth.

24. Let u(t, x) be twice continuously differentiable in x and once int, for x € R and t € [0, T]. Let
W be the standard Wiener process. Show that u is a solution of the heat equation

if and only if the process U; = u(T —t, Wr), 0 <1 < T, has zero drift.
