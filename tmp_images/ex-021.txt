[2.5.1]-{2.7.4] Exercises Random variables and their distributions

2.5 Exercises. Random vectors
1. A fair coin is tossed twice. Let X be the number of heads, and let W be the indicator function of
the event {X = 2}. Find P(X = x, W = w) for all appropriate values of x and w.

2. Let X bea Bernoulli random variable, so that PX = 0) = 1— p, P(X = 1) = p. LetY = 1-X
and Z = XY. Find P(X =x, Y = y) and P(X =x, Z =z) forx, y,z € {0, 1}.

3. The random variables X and Y have joint distribution function
0 ifx <0,

Fy,y(, y) = 11
x,y (x y) (1 —e7*) (5 + ~ tan! ) ifx > 0.

Show that X and Y are (jointly) continuously distributed.
4. Let X and Y have joint distribution function F. Show that

Pla < X <b,ce<Y<d)=F(b,d) — F(a,d) — F(b,c)+ Flac)

whenever a < bandc <d.
5. Let X, Y be discrete random variables taking values in the integers, with joint mass function f.
Show that, for integers x, y,

f@, y= P(X>x,¥ <y)-PX2>x4+1,¥ <y)
—-PX>x,¥ <y-)4+P(X2x4+1,¥ <y-D.
Hence find the joint mass function of the smallest and largest numbers shown in r rolls of a fair die.

6. Is the function F(x, y) = 1 — e-*7, 0 < x, y < on, the joint distribution function of some pair
of random variables?

2.7 Problems

1. Each toss of a coin results in a head with probability p. The coin is tossed until the first head
appears. Let X be the total number of tosses. What is P(X > m)? Find the distribution function of
the random variable X.

2. (a) Show that any discrete random variable may be written as a linear combination of indicator
variables.

(b) Show that any random variable may be expressed as the limit of an increasing sequence of discrete
random variables.

(c) Show that the limit of any increasing convergent sequence of random variables is a random
variable.

3. (a) Show that, if X and Y are random variables on a probability space (Q, ¥, P), then so are
X+Y, XY, and min{X, Y}.

(b) Show that the set of all random variables on a given probability space (Q, F, P) constitutes a
vector space over the reals. If Q is finite, write down a basis for this space.

4. Let X have distribution function

0 ifx <0,
F(x)=4 5x if0<x <2,
1 if x > 2,
