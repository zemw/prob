[6.15.14]-[6.15.19] Exercises Markov chains

Let A and 6 be positive constants and suppose that aj = 1 — Ai —B for all large i. Show that the
chain is
(c) transient if 6 > 1,
(d) non-null persistent if 6 < 1.
Finally, if 6 = 1 show that the chain is
(e) non-null persistent if A > 1,
(f) null persistent if A < 1.
14, Let X be a continuous-time Markov chain with countable state space S and standard semigroup
{P;}. Show that p;;(t) is a continuous function of t. Let g(t) = —log pj; (t); show that g is a
continuous function, g(0) = 0, and g(s +t) < g(s)+ g(t). We say that g is ‘subadditive’, and a well
known theorem gives the result that

t t

Deduce that gj; = lim;)9 tr! {pi (t) — 1} exists, but may be —oo.

15, Let X be acontinuous-time Markov chain with generatorG = (g;;) and suppose that the transition

semigroup P; satisfies P; = exp(tG). Show that X is irreducible if and only if for any pair i, j of

States there exists a sequence k;, ky,..., kn of states such that gj £, 8k, ,ky °° * Sknj 7% 9-

16. (a) Let X = {X(t) : —co < t < co} be a Markov chain with stationary distribution 7, and
suppose that X (0) has distribution w. We call X reversible if X and Y have the same joint
distributions, where Y(t) = X(-1).

G) If X(t) has distribution w for all t, show that Y is a Markov chain with transition probabilities
P; j (t) = (1; /m;) pji(t), where the p;;(t) are the transition probabilities of the chain X.
(ii) If the transition semigroup {P;} of X is standard with generator G, show that 7; 93; = 10j 8ji
(for all i and j) is a necessary condition for X to be reversible.
(iii) If P; = exp(tG), show that X(z) has distribution w for all t and that the condition in (ii) is
sufficient for the chain to be reversible.
(b) Show that every irreducible chain X with exactly two states is reversible in equilibrium.
(c) Show that every birth—-death process X having a stationary distribution is reversible in equilibrium.

17. Show that not every discrete-time Markov chain can be imbedded in a continuous-time chain.
More precisely, let

P= 4", i) for some 0 <a <1

be a transition matrix. Show that there exists a uniform semigroup {P;} of transition probabilities in
continuous time such that P; = P, if and only if 4 <a < 1. Inthis case show that {P;} is unique and
calculate it in terms of a.

18. Consider an immigration—death process X(t), being a birth-death process with rates A, = A,
[in = nw. Show that its generating function G(s, t) = E(s* ®) is given by

G(s,t) = 1+ @ — De} exp{p(s — DU — e #4}

where p = A/j and X(0) = I. Deduce the limiting distribution of X(t) as t — oo.

19, Let N be a non-homogeneous Poisson process on R_ = [0, oo) with intensity function A. Write
down the forward and backward equations for NV, and solve them.

Let N(0) = 0, and find the density function of the time T until the first arrival in the process. If
A(t) = c/(1 +1), show that E(T) < 00 if and only ifc > 1.
