2. Set Ag = Q for notational convenience. Expand each term on the right-hand side to obtain

3. Let M be the event that the first coin is double-headed, R the event that it is double-tailed, and
N the event that it is normal. Let Hj be the event that the lower face is a head on the ith toss, Ti the
event that the upper face is a tail on the ith toss, and so on. Then, using conditional probability ad
nauseam, we find:

(v) From (iv), the probability that he discards a double-headed coin is 4, the probability that he

discards a normal coin is 7 (There is of course no chance of it being double-tailed.) Hence, by
conditioning on the discard,

4. The final calculation of 5 refers not to a single draw of one ball from an urn containing three, but
rather to a composite experiment comprising more than one stage (in this case, two stages). While it
is true that {two black, one white} is the only fixed collection of balls for which a random choice is
black with probability 3, the composition of the urn is not determined prior to the final draw.

After all, if Carroll’s argument were correct then it would apply also in the situation when the urn
originally contains just one ball, either black or white. The final probability is now 3, implying that
the original ball was one half black and one half white! Carroll was himself aware of the fallacy in
this argument.

5. (a) One cannot compute probabilities without knowing the rules governing the conditional prob-
abilities. If the first door chosen conceals a goat, then the presenter has no choice in the door to be
opened, since exactly one of the remaining doors conceals a goat. If the first door conceals the car, then
a choice is necessary, and this is governed by the protocol of the presenter. Consider two ‘extremal’
protocols for this latter situation.

G) The presenter opens a door chosen at random from the two available.

(ii) There is some ordering of the doors (left to right, perhaps) and the presenter opens the earlier

door in this ordering which conceals a goat.

Analysis of the two situations yields p = 5 under (i), and p = 4 under (ii).
