[5.12.7]-[5.12.8] Solutions Generating functions and their applications

by (5.3.3). Using Stirling’s formula, pp(2n) ~ (nx)~', and therefore Yn Po(2n) = oo, implying
that the chance of eventual return is 1.

A longer method is as follows. The walk is at the origin at time 0 if and only if it has taken equal
numbers of leftward and rightward steps, and also equal numbers of upward and downward steps.

Therefore 3
five (2n)! _ (1\*" (2n

7, Let e;; be the probability the walk ever reaches j having started from i. Clearly e¢g9 =
€a,a—1€a—1,a—2°** 10, Since a passage to 0 from a requires a passage to a — 1, then a passage
to a — 2, and so on. By homogeneity, ego = (€10)°.

By conditioning on the value of the first step, we find that ej9 = pe3q + geo = pedo +q. The
cubic equation x = px +q has roots x = 1, c, d, where

ea Pave +4pa P+ pt + 40g
2p , 2p ,

Now |c| > 1, and |d| > 1 if and only if p* +4pq > 9p* which is to say that p < 3. It follows that
ego=lifp< 3, 80 that ego =lifp< $.
When p > 3 we have that d < 1, and it is actually the case that e179 = d, and hence

a
_ (-p+vp? +4pq 1
€a0 = Dp if p > 3.

In order to prove this, it suffices to prove that egg < 1 for all large a; this is a minor but necessary
chore. Write T, = Sn — So = >-7_, Xi, where X; is the value of the ith step. Then

€go = P(T, < —a for somen > 1) = P(np — Th > nu +a for some n > 1)

oo

n=1
where 2. = E(X,) = 2p — g > 0. As in the theory of large deviations, for ¢ > 0,
P(np — Tn > np +a) < et Ht (pel HX)"
where X is a typical step. Now E(e’—*)) = 1 + o(t) ast | 0, and therefore we may pick t > 0

such that @(t) = e#E(e"#-%)) < 1. It follows that egg < S~O2, e7'40(t)" which is less than 1
for all large a, as required.

8. We have that
E(s*e¥ | X+¥=n)= i tn *(; ) ar = (ps + qt)",

where p + q = 1. Hence Gy y(s,t) = G(ps + qt) where G is the probability generating function
of X + Y. Now X and FY are independent, so that

G(ps + qt) = Gx(s)Gy(@) = Gy y(s, DGx,y (1, ft) = G(ps + q)G(p + 4t).
