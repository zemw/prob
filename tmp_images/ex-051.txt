[4.14.20]-[4.14.27] Exercises Continuous random variables

(b) If, given that X + Y = u, X/u has a given beta distribution (parameters a and f, say) whatever
the value of u, show that X and Y have gamma distributions.

You may need the fact that the only non-negative continuous solutions of the functional equation
g(s +t) = g(s)g(t) for s,t > 0, with g(0) = 1, are of the form g(s) = e#*. Remember Problem
(4.14.5).

20. Show that it cannot be the case that U = X + Y where U is uniformly distributed on [0, 1] and X
and Y are independent and identically distributed. You should not assume that X and Y are continuous
variables.

21. Order statistics. Let X|, X2,..., Xn be independent identically distributed variables with acom-
mon density function f. Suchacollectionis calleda random sample. Foreachw € Q, arrange the sam-
ple values X1(@),..., Xn() in non-decreasing order X(j)(@) < X(2)(@) < «++ < Xn) (@), where
(1), (2),..., (@) is a (random) permutation of 1,2,...,. The new variables Xy, X(2).-- +» Xm)
are called the order statistics. Show, by a symmetry argument, that the joint distribution function of
the order statistics satisfies

where L is given by
L(x) = { 1 if xy <*2 <s++ < Xp,
0 otherwise,

and X = (%1,%2,...,%n). Deduce that the joint density function of X(1),..-,Xq) is g(y) =
aLiy)fO)--- £On).
22, Find the marginal density function of the kth order statistic X(,) of a sample with size n:
(a) by integrating the result of Problem (4.14.21),
(b) directly.

23. Find the joint density function of the order statistics of n independent uniform variables on [0, 7].

24. Let X1, X2,..., Xn be independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1], with order statistics

X 1), X(2)s ++ Xen):

(a) Show that, for fixed k, the density function of n.X(,) converges as n — oo, and find and identify
the limit function.

(b) Show that log Xj) has the same distribution as — )77_, i-1Y;, where the Y; are independent
random variables having the exponential distribution with parameter 1.

(c) Show that Z1, Z2,..., Zn, defined by Z, = (Xay/X eer fork < nand Zy = (X(qy)", are
independent random variables with the uniform distribution on [0, 1].

25. Let X,, X2, X3 be independent variables with the uniform distribution on [0,1]. What is the
probability that rods of lengths X,, X2, and X3 may be used to make a triangle? Generalize your
answer to n rods used to form a polygon.

26. Let X, and X be independent variables with the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. A stick of unit
length is broken at points distance X; and X 7 from one of the ends. What is the probability that the
three pieces may be used to make a triangle? Generalize your answer to a stick broken in n places.

27. Let X, Y be a pair of jointly continuous variables.
(a) Hélder’s inequality. Show that if p,q > 1 and p~! +q7! = 1 then

E|XY| < {E|x?|}!/? {eva} '/4.
