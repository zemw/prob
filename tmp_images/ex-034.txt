Problems Exercises [3.11.15]-[3.11.21]

Show that, for E(Y) fixed, var(Y) is a maximum when p; = p2 = -:- = pn. That is to say, the
variation in the sum is greatest when individuals are most alike. Is this contrary to intuition?

15. Let X = (Xj, X2,..., Xn) bea vector of random variables. The covariance matrix V(X) of X is
defined to be the symmetric n by n matrix with entries (vj; : 1 <i, 7 <n) givenby uj; = cov(X;, X;).
Show that |[VCX)| = 0 if and only if the X; are linearly dependent with probability one, in that
P(a,X1 +a2X2 +---+anXpn = b) = 1 for some a and b. (|V| denotes the determinant of V.)

16. Let X and Y be independent Bernoulli random variables with parameter 5. Show that X + Y and
|X — Y| are dependent though uncorrelated.

17. A secretary drops n matching pairs of letters and envelopes down the stairs, and then places the
letters into the envelopes in a random order. Use indicators to show that the number X of correctly
matched pairs has mean and variance 1 for all n > 2. Show that the mass function of X converges to
a Poisson mass function as n —> oo.

18. LetX = (Xj, X2,..., Xn) bea vector of independent random variables each having the Bernoulli

distribution with parameter p. Let f : {0, 1}” — R be increasing, which is to say that f(x) < f(y)

whenever x; < y; for eachi.

(a) Let e(p) = E( f(X)). Show that e(p1) < e(p2) if pi < po.

(b) FKG inequality}. Let f and g be increasing functions from {0, 1}” into R. Show by induction
on n that cov( f (X), g(K)) > 0.

19. Let R(p) be the reliability function of a network G with a given source and sink, each edge of
which is working with probability p, and let A be the event that there exists a working connection
from source to sink. Show that

R(p) = S T4(@) pN@ (1 — pym-N@)

where w is a typical realization (i.e., outcome) of the network, N(w) is the number of working edges
of w, and m is the total number of edges of G.
Deduce that R’(p) = cov(J4, N)/{p(1 — p)}, and hence that

R(p)(1 — R(p)) _ oy mR(p)(1 — R(p))

20. Let R(:p) be the reliability function of a network G, each edge of which is working with probability

p.

(a) Show that R(pi p2) < R(p1)R(p2) if0 < pi, p2 <1.

(b) Show that R(p”) < R(p)” for all0 < p< landy > 1.

21. DNA fingerprinting. In a certain style of detective fiction, the sleuth is required to declare “‘the

criminal has the unusual characteristics ...; find this person and you have your man”. Assume that

any given individual has these unusual characteristics with probability 10—7 independently of all other

individuals, and that the city in question contains 107 inhabitants. Calculate the expected number of

such people in the city.

(a) Given that the police inspector finds such a person, what is the probability that there is at least
one other?

(b) If the inspector finds two such people, what is the probability that there is at least one more?

(c) How many such people need be found before the inspector can be reasonably confident that he

has found them all?
