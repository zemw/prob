6.13 Solutions. Spatial Poisson processes

1. It is easy to check from the axioms that the combined process N(t) = B(t) + G(t) is a Poisson
process with intensity B + y.

(a) The time S$ (respectively, T) until the arrival of the first brown (respectively, grizzly) bear is
exponentially distributed with parameter B (respectively, y), and these times are independent. Now,

(b) Using (a), and the lack-of-memory of the process, the required probability is

2. Let B, be the ball with centre 0 and radius r, and let N- = |T] MN B;|. We have by Theorem
(6.13.11) that S, = xelins, g(x) satisfies

where A(B) = Sye p(y) dy. Therefore, E(S,) = f By g(w)A(u) du, implying by monotone conver-
gence that E(S) = faa g(u)A(u) du. Similarly,

By monotone convergence,
E(S?) = | g(u)2A(u) du + E(S)2,
By

and the formula for the variance follows.

3. If B,, Bo,..., By, are disjoint regions of the disc, then the numbers of projected points therein
are Poisson-distributed and independent, since they originate from disjoint regions of the sphere. By
