and let Y = X2. Find

@P(4<X<3), QOPU<X <2),
(c) PY < X), (d) P(X < 2Y),
(ec) P(X +¥ <3), _ (f) the distribution function of Z = VX.
5. Let X have distribution function
0 ifx < —l,
1-p if —l<x <0,
l—-p+yxp if0<x <2,
1 ifx > 2.

Sketch this function, and find: (a) PX = —1), (b) P(X =0), (c) P(X > 1).

6. Buses arrive at ten minute intervals starting at noon. A man arrives at the bus stop a random
number X minutes after noon, where X has distribution function

0 ifx <0,
P(X <x) = x/60 if0 <x < 60,
1 if x > 60.

What is the probability that he waits less than five minutes for a bus?

7. Airlines find that each passenger who reserves a seat fails to turn up with probability b inde-
pendently of the other passengers. So Teeny Weeny Airlines always sell 10 tickets for their 9 seat
aeroplane while Blockbuster Airways always sell 20 tickets for their 18 seat aeroplane. Which is more
often over-booked?

8. A fairground performer claims the power of telekinesis. The crowd throws coins and he wills
them to fall heads up. He succeeds five times out of six. What chance would he have of doing at least
as well if he had no supernatural powers?

9, Express the distribution functions of
Xt = max{0, X}, X~ =~min{0O,X}, |X|=X7t+4X7, —-X,

in terms of the distribution function F of the random variable X.
10. Show that Fy (x) is continuous at x = xo if and only if P(X = xp) = 0.

11. The real number m is called a median of the distribution function F whenever limysm F(y) <

5 < F(m). Show that every distribution function F has at least one median, and that the set of

medians of F is a closed interval of R.

12. Show that it is not possible to weight two dice in such a way that the sum of the two numbers
shown by these loaded dice is equally likely to take any value between 2 and 12 (inclusive).

13. A function d : S x S — Ris called a metric on S if:
(@) d(s,t) =d(t,s) > Oforalls,t € S,
Gi) d(s, t) = Oif and only if s = t, and
Giii) d(s,t) < d(s,u) + d(u,t) foralls,t,ue¢ S.
(a) Lévy metric. Let F and G be distribution functions and define the Lévy metric

a (F, G) = inf {¢ >0:Ga@—«)-e< F@)<Gat+et+e for all x}.
Show that dy, is indeed a metric on the space of distribution functions.
