[4.14.35]-[4.14.42] Exercises Continuous random variables

are independent and uniformly distributed on {0, 1]. This is equivalent to Problem (4.14.33). Why?

35. Secretary/marriage problem. You are permitted to inspect the n prizes at a féte in a given order,
at each stage either rejecting or accepting the prize under consideration. There is no recall, in the sense
that no rejected prize may be accepted later. It may be assumed that, given complete information, the
prizes may be ranked in a strict order of preference, and that the order of presentation is independent
of this ranking. Find the strategy which maximizes the probability of accepting the best prize, and
describe its behaviour when n is large.

36. Fisher’s spherical distribution. Let R? = X24 Y¥2+4 Z2 where X , Y, Z are independent normal
random variables with means i, jz, v, and common variance a”, where (A, #,v”) 4 (0, 0,0). Show
that the conditional density of the point (X, Y, Z) given R = r, when expressed in spherical polar
coordinates relative to an axis in the direction e = (A, yz, v), is of the form

37. Let @ be the N(O, 1) density function, and define the functions H,, n > 0, by Ayo = 1, and

38. Lancaster’s theorem. Let X and Y have a standard bivariate normal distribution with zero
means, unit variances, and correlation coefficient o, and suppose U = u(X) and V = v(Y) have finite
variances. Show that |o(U, V)| < |o|. [Hint: Use Problem (4.14.37) to expand the functions u and
v. You may assume that u and v lie in the linear span of the Ay.)

40. (a) Let X, Y, Z be independent N(O, 1) variables, and set R = VX 24 y¥24 72. Show that
x? / R? has a beta distribution with parameters 4 and 1, and is independent of R?,

(b) Let X, Y, Z be independent and uniform on [—1, 1] and set R = X24 ¥2+4 Z2. Find the

41. Let ¢ and ® be the standard normal density and distribution functions. Show that:

(b) f() = 26(x) Px), —00 < x < ov, is the density function of some random variable (denoted

(c) Let X be astandard normal random variable independent of Y, anddefine Z = (X-+A|Y|)/V/1 +22.
Write down the joint density of Z and |Y|, and deduce that Z has density function /.
