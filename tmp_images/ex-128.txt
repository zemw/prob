Crossings and convergence Exercises [12.2.1]-[12.3.4]

12.2 Exercises. Martingale differences and Hoeffding’s inequality

1. Knapsack problem. It is required to pack a knapsack to maximum benefit. Suppose you have n
objects, the ith object having volume V; and worth W;, where V;, V2,..., Vn, Wy, Wo. ..., Wn are
independent non-negative random variables with finite means, and W; < M for all i and some fixed
M. Your knapsack has volume c, and you wish to maximize the total worth of the objects packed in
it. That is, you wish to find the vector 21, z2,..., Zn of 0’s and 1’s such that }77 2;V; <c and which
maximizes S~Y 2; W,;. Let Z be the maximal possible worth of the knapsack’s contents, and show that

P(|Z —EZ| > x) < 2exp{—x?/(2nM2)} for x > 0.

2. Graph colouring. Given n vertices v1, v2,..., Un, for each 1 < i < j <n we place an edge
between v; and v; with probability p; different pairs are joined independently of each other. We call
v; and v; neighbours if they are joined by an edge. The chromatic number x of the ensuing graph is
the minimal number of pencils of different colours which are required in order that each vertex may
be coloured differently from each of its neighbours. Show that P(jx — Ex| > x) < 2exp{- 5x? jn}
for x > 0.

12.3 Exercises. Crossings and convergence

1, Give a reasonable definition of a downcrossing of the interval [a, b] by the random sequence

Yo, Y1,..--

(a) Show that the number of downcrossings differs from the number of upcrossings by at most 1.

(b) If (Y, F) is a submartingale, show that the number D,,(a, b; Y) of downcrossings of [a, b] by Y
up to time n satisfies

E{(¥n — b)*}

—a

EDy(a, b; Y) <

2. Let (Y, &) be a supermartingale with finite means, and let U,(a, b; Y) be the number of upcross-
ings of the interval [a, b] up to time n. Show that

E{Y¥n —a)7}

EU, (a, b; Y) <
b-a

Deduce that EU, (a, b; Y) < a/(b — a) if Y is non-negative and a > 0.

3. Let X be a Markov chain with countable state space S and transition matrix P. Suppose that X is
irreducible and persistent, and that yy : S > Sis abounded function satisfying }~ jeS Pij ¥G)<¥@
for i € S. Show that w is a constant function.

4. Let Z,, Zo, ... be independent random variables such that:

an with probability }n~?,

Zn=4 0 with probability 1 — n—?,
—ay with probability 5n~?,

where aj = 2 and ay, = 4 a;. Show that Y, = j=l Z; defines a martingale. Show that
Y = lim Y, exists almost surely, but that there exists no M such that E|Y,| < M for all xn.
