In each packet of Corn Flakes may be found a plastic bust of one of the last five Vice-Chancellors
of Cambridge University, the probability that any given packet contains any specific Vice-Chancellor
being 7 independently of all other packets. Show that the probability that each of the last three

Vice-Chancellors is obtained in a bulk purchase of six packets is 1 — 3(4)° + 3(3)6 - (3).
5. Let A;,r > 1, be events such that P(A,) = 1 for all r. Show that P((\72, Ar) = 1.

6. You are given that at least one of the events Ay, 1 <r <n, is certain to occur, but certainly no
more than two occur. If P(A;) = p, and P(Ay 1 As) = q,r #5, show that p > 1/nandgq <2/n.

7. You are given that at least one, but no more than three, of the events A;, 1 <r <n, occur, where
n > 3. The probability of at least two occurring is 4. If P(A;) = p, P(Ar N As) = g,r #8, and
P(Ap N As MN At) = x,7r <5 < t, show that p > 3/(2n), andg <4/n.

1.4 Exercises. Conditional probability

1. Prove that P(A | B) = P(B | A)P(A)/P(B) whenever P(A)P(B) ¥ 0. Show that, if P(A | B) >
P(A), then P(B | A) > PCB).

2. For events Aj, A2,..., An Satisfying P(A, MN Az N---M Ap_1) > 0, prove that

P(A, 1 A2M-+-M An) = P(A1)P(A2 | A1)PCA3 | At 9 A2)---P(An | At A20--- 9 Ap—1).

3. A man possesses five coins, two of which are double-headed, one is double-tailed, and two are
normal. He shuts his eyes, picks a coin at random, and tosses it. What is the probability that the lower
face of the coin is a head?

He opens his eyes and sees that the coin is showing heads; what is the probability that the lower
face is a head?

He shuts his eyes again, and tosses the coin again. What is the probability that the lower face is
a head?

He opens his eyes and sees that the coin is showing heads; what is the probability that the lower
face is a head?

He discards this coin, picks another at random, and tosses it. What is the probability that it shows
heads?

4. What do you think of the following ‘proof’ by Lewis Carroll that an urn cannot contain two balls
of the same colour? Suppose that the urn contains two balls, each of which is either black or white;
thus, in the obvious notation, P(BB) = P(BW) = P(WB) = P(WW) = 1) We add a black ball, so
that PCBBB) = P(BBW) = P(BWB) = P(BWW) = i Next we pick a ball at random; the chance
that the ball is black is (using conditional probabilities) 1 - 4 + 3 . 4 + 5 . i + 3 . 4 = i. However, if
there is probability 3 that a ball, chosen randomly from three, is black, then there must be two black
and one white, which is to say that originally there was one black and one white ball in the urn.

5. The Monty Hall problem: goats and cars. (a) Cruel fate has made you a contestant in a game
show; you have to choose one of three doors. One conceals a new car, two conceal old goats. You
