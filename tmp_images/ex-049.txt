[4.14.2]-[4.14.11] Exercises Continuous random variables

2. Let X be continuous with density function f(x) = C(x — x”), where wa < x < BandC >0.,
(a) What are the possible values of a and 6?

(b) What is C?

3. Let X be arandom variable which takes non-negative values only. Show that

4. (a) Let X have a continuous distribution function F. Show that
G) F(X) is uniformly distributed on [0, 1],
Gi) — log F(X) is exponentially distributed.

(b) A straight line / touches a circle with unit diameter at the point P which is diametrically opposed
on the circle to another point Q. A straight line QR joins Q to some point R on J. If the angle POR
between the lines PQ and QR is a random variable with the uniform distribution on [-57, 57],
show that the length of PR has the Cauchy distribution (this length is measured positive or negative
depending upon which side of P the point R lies).

5. Let X have an exponential distribution. Show that P(X > s+.x |X > s) = P(X > x), for
x,s > 0. This is the ‘lack of memory’ property again. Show that the exponential distribution is the
only continuous distribution with this property. You may need to use the fact that the only non-negative
monotonic solutions of the functional equation g(s + t) = g(s)g(t) for s,t > 0, with g(0) = 1, are
of the form g(s) = e“*. Can you prove this?

6. Show that X and Y are independent continuous variables if and only if their joint density function
J factorizes as the product f(x, y) = g(x)h(y) of functions of the single variables x and y alone.

7. Let X and Y have joint density function f(x, y) = 2e°-*-7, 0 < x < y < oo. Are they
independent? Find their marginal density functions and their covariance.

8. Bertrand’s paradox extended. A chord of the unit circle is picked at random. What is the

probability that an equilateral triangle with the chord as base can fit inside the circle if:

(a) the chord passes through a point P picked uniformly in the disk, and the angle it makes with a
fixed direction is uniformly distributed on [0, 27),

(b) the chord passes through a point P picked uniformly at random on a randomly chosen radius, and
the angle it makes with the radius is uniformly distributed on [0, 27r).

9. Monte Carlo. It is required to estimate J = So g(x) dx where 0 < g(x) < 1 for all x, as
in Example (2.6.3). Let X and Y be independent random variables with common density function
f(x) = 1if 0 <x <1, f(x) = 0 otherwise. Let U = Ipy<g(x)}, the indicator function of the event
that Y < 9(X), andlet V = g(X),W = 5{g(X)+e(1—X)}. Show that E(U) = E(V) = E(W) = J,
and that var(W) < var(V) < var(U), so that, of the three, W is the most ‘efficient’ estimator of J.

10. Let X1, X2,..., Xn be independent exponential variables, parameter 1. Show by induction that
S=X,+Xo.+---+ Xy has the P(A, n) distribution.

11. Let X and Y be independent variables, [(A, m) and (A, n) respectively.

(a) Use the result of Problem (4.14.10) to show that X + Y is [(A, m+n) when m and n are integral
(the same conclusion is actually valid for non-integral m and 7).
