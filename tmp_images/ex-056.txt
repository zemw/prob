57. Show that it is possible to position a convex rock of surface area S in sunlight in such a way that
its shadow has area at least iS .

58. Dirichlet distribution. Let {X; : 1 <r < k + 1} be independent ['(,, f,) random variables
(respectively).

(a) Show that ¥, = X,/(X, +---+ Xr), 2 <r <k +1, are independent random variables.

(b) Show that Z; = X,/(X] +-+++ Xg41), 1 <r <k, have the joint Dirichlet density

59. Hotelling’s theorem. Let X; = (X1,;, X27,..., Xmr), 1 <7 <n, be independent multivariate

normal random vectors having zero means and the same covariance matrix V = (v;;). Show that the
two random variables

are identically distributed.

60. Choose P, Q, and R independently at random in the square S(a) of side a. Show that E/PQR| =
11a? /144. Deduce that four points picked at random in a parallelogram form a convex quadrilateral
with probability (3).

61. Choose P, Q, and R uniformly at random within the convex region C illustrated beneath. By

considering the event that four randomly chosen points form a triangle, or otherwise, show that the
mean area of the shaded region is three times the mean area of the triangle PQR.

62. Multivariate normal sampling. Let V be a positive-definite symmetric n x n matrix, and L
a lower-triangular matrix such that V = L’L,; this is called the Cholesky decomposition of V. Let
X = (X, X2,..., Xn) be a vector of independent random variables distributed as N(0, 1). Show that
the vector Z = ft + XL has the multivariate normal distribution with mean vector yz and covariance
matrix V.

63. Verifying matrix multiplications. We need to decide whether or not AB = C where A, B, C are
given n x n matrices, and we adopt the following random algorithm. Let x be a random {0, 1}”-valued
vector, each of the 2” possibilities being equally likely. If (AB — C)x = 0, we decide that AB = C,
and otherwise we decide that AB 4 C. Show that

Describe a similar procedure which results in an error probability which may be made as small as
desired.
