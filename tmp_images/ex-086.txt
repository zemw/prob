defines the n-step transition probabilities of a persistent irreducible Markov chain on S whose
first-passage probabilities are given by

where Jj;(1) = P(Xn =i, T >| Xo = j) and T = min{m > 0: Xm = j}.

(b) Show that x is unique up to a multiplicative constant.

(c) Let Tj = min{n > 1: Xn = j} and define hj; = P(Z; < T; | Xo =i). Show that x;hjj = xjhjj

8. Renewal sequences. The sequence u = {uy : n > 0} is called a ‘renewal sequence’ if
n
ug = 1, un = >> fini forn > 1,

for some collection f = {f, : n > 1} of non-negative numbers summing to 1.

(a) Show that u is a renewal sequence if and only if there exists a Markov chain X on a countable
state space S such that u, = P(X, =s | Xp =), for some persistent s € S and all n > 1.

(b) Show that if u and v are renewal sequences then so is {uyvpy, in > O}.

9. Consider the symmetric random walk in three dimensions on the set of points {(x, y, z) : x, y,Z

and deduce by Stirling’s formula that the origin is a transient state.

10. Consider the three-dimensional version of the cancer model (6.12.16). If « = 1, are the empires
of Theorem (6.12.18) inevitable in this case?

11. Let X bea discrete-time Markov chain with state space S = {1, 2}, and transition matrix

Classify the states of the chain. Suppose that a6 > 0 and af # 1. Find the n-step transition

probabilities and show directly that they converge to the unique stationary distribution as n — oo.
For what values of a and 6 is the chain reversible in equilibrium?

12. Another diffusion model. N black balls and N white balls are placed in two urns so that each
contains N balls. After each unit of time one ball is selected at random from each urn, and the two
balls thus selected are interchanged. Let the number of black balls in the first urn denote the state
of the system. Write down the transition matrix of this Markov chain and find the unique stationary
distribution. Is the chain reversible in equilibrium?

13. Consider a Markov chain on the set S = {0, 1,2, ...} with transition probabilities p;;.1 = a;,
Pi,g = 1 —a;, i > O, where (a; : i = 0) is a sequence of constants which satisfy 0 < a; < 1 for alli.
Let bg = 1, bj = aga, ---a;_1 fori > 1. Show that the chain is

(a) persistent if and only if bj > 0 asi — oo,

(b) non-null persistent if and only if 7; bj < 00,

and write down the stationary distribution if the latter condition holds.
