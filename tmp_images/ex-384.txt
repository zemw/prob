Renewal-reward processes Solutions [10.4.1]-[10.5.3]

10.4 Solution. Applications

1. Visualize a renewal as arriving after two stages, type 1 stages being exponential parameter 2 and
type 2 stages being exponential parameter 2. The ‘stage’ process is the flip-flop two-state Markov
process of Exercise (6.9.1). With an obvious notation,

Hence the excess lifetime distribution is a mixture of the exponential distribution with parameter y,
and the distribution of the sum of two exponential random variables, thus,

2. Suppose you are paid a reward at unit rate during every interarrival time of type X, i.e., at all
times ¢ at which M(t) is even. By the renewal-reward theorem (10.5.1),

3. Suppose, at time ¢, you are paid a reward at rate C(t). The expected reward during an interval
(cycle) of length X is Se sds = 5X 2 | since the age C is the same at the time s into the interval. The
