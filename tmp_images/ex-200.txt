if x + 0, since the integrand is the N(0, x~*) density function. It is easily seen that g(0) = 0, so that

Also fg is the uniform limit of continuous functions on any subset of R? of the form [—M, M] x R;
hence fg is continuous. Hence fg is a continuous density function. On the other hand

2. We may assume that the centre of the rod is uniformly positioned in a square of size a x b, while
the acute angle between the rod and a line of the first grid is uniform on (0, hn). If the latter angle is
6 then, with the aid of a diagram, one finds that there is no intersection if and only if the centre of the
rod lies within a certain inner rectangle of size (a — r cos@) x (b —r sin@). Hence the probability of
an intersection is

3. (i) Let J be the indicator of the event that the first needle intersects a line, and let J be the indicator
that the second needle intersects a line. By the result of Exercise (4.5.2), EU) = E(J) = 2/z; hence
Z=1+ J satisfies E(4Z) = 2/7.
