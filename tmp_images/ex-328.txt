where we have used the fact that F mj pjk(t) = me. Now a;(s) —> mj ass — oo, and therefore
d(t) > c(1).

The function c(x) = —x~“ is concave, and the claim follows by the result of the previous problem.

39. This may be done in a variety of ways, by breaking up the distribution of a typical displacement and
using the superposition theorem (6.13.5), by the colouring theorem (6.13.14), or by Rényi’s theorem
(6.13.17) as follows. Let B be a closed bounded region of R?, We colour a point of Tl atx ¢ R@
black with probability P(x + X € B), where X is a typical displacement. By the colouring theorem,
the number of black points has a Poisson distribution with parameter

[ AP@+X¢ Bydx=3 | ay [ P(X € dy —x)
Rd yeB xeR?

= / ay | P(X Edy) =A|BI,
yeB verR?d

by the change of variables v = y — x. Therefore the probability that no displaced point lies in B is
e~4181, and the claim follows by Rényi’s theorem.

40. Conditional on the number N(s) of points originally in the interval (0, s), the positions of these
points are jointly distributed as uniform random variables, so the mean number of these points which
lie in (—c<, a) after the perturbation satisfies

Ss ] OO

os 0

where X is a typical displacement. Likewise, E(Lp) = 4 Sor [1 — Fy (a + u)] du. Equality is valid
if and only if

OO a
[u-Feonde= [ Freyas,
a —C
which is equivalent to a = E(X), by Exercise (4.3.5).
The last part follows immediately on setting X; = V-t, where V;, is the velocity of the rth car.

41. Conditional on the number N(*) of arrivals by time ft, the arrival times of these ants are distributed
as independent random variables with the uniform distribution. Let U be a typical arrival time, so
that U is uniformly distributed on (0, ¢). The arriving ant is in the pantry at time t with probability
nx =P(U +X > 2), or in the sink with probability 9 = P(U + X <t <U +X +), or departed
with probability 1 — o — a. Thus,

E(x4)y8O) _ E{E(x40 yBO | N(t)) }

=E{(ax+pyt+tl—a—- pyNOr = ftA-NeheY-D_

Thus A(t) and B(t) are independent Poisson-distributed random variables. If the ants arrive in pairs
and then separate,

E(x4M y3O | N(t)) = {1r2x? + Inpxy + py” + 2ymx +2ypy + y2}NO
