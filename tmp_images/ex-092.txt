Problems Exercises [6.15.47]-[6.15.49]

(a) for any A C R, |P(X; € A) — P(¥; € A)| > Oast > ~,

(b) if P(X < Yo) = 1, then Ef[g(X:)] < Elg(¥;)] for any increasing function g.

47, Resources. The number of birds in a wood at time ¢ is a continuous-time Markov process X. Food
resources impose the constraint 0 < X(t) < n. Competition entails that the transition probabilities

obey
Pke+i(h) = An — kh + off), Pkk—-1(h) = wkh + o(h).

Find E(s*), together with the mean and variance of X(t), when X(0) = r. What happens as
t—> 00?

48. Parrando’s paradox. A counter performs an irreducible random walk on the vertices 0, 1, 2 of
the triangle in the figure beneath, with transition matrix

0 po qo
P=|q O pi
p2 492 OO

where p; + qj = 1 for all i. Show that the stationary distribution w has

_ 1—qopi

with corresponding formulae for 7, 72.

Suppose that you gain one peseta for each clockwise step of the walk, and you lose one peseta
for each anticlockwise step. Show that, in equilibrium, the mean yield per step is

_ _ 3@poP1P2 — PoP1 — P1P2— P2Po + Po + Pi + p2— 1)
y= 2p; - Dm = 3
; — 41 P0 — 92P1 — GoP2

Consider now three cases of this process:
A. Wehave p; = 5 —a for eachi, where a > 0. Show that the mean yield per step satisfies ya < 0.

B. We have that pp = tb —a,pj=pr.= ; — a, where a > 0. Show that yg < 0 for sufficiently
small a.

C. At each step the counter is equally likely to move according to the transition probabilities of
case A or case B, the choice being made independently at every step. Show that, in this case,
Po= a —a, pi, = pr2= 3 — a. Show that yc > 0 for sufficiently small a.

The fact that two systematically unfavourable games may be combined to make a favourable game is
called Parrando’s paradox. Such bets are not available in casinos.

49. Cars arrive at the beginning of a long road in a Poisson stream of rate 4 from time ¢ = 0 onwards.
A car has a fixed velocity V > 0 which is a random variable. The velocities of cars are independent
and identically distributed, and independent of the arrival process. Cars can overtake each other freely.
Show that the number of cars on the first x miles of the road at time ¢ has the Poisson distribution with
parameter AE[V~! min{x, Vf}].
