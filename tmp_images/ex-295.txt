6.5 Solutions. Reversibility

1. Look for a solution to the equations 2; pj; = 7; p;i- The only non-trivial cases of interest are
those with j = i+ 1, and therefore Aja; = j417j;41 for 0 <i < b, with solution

an empty product being interpreted as 1. The constant zg is chosen in order that the z; sum to 1, and
the chain is therefore time-reversible.

2. Leta be the stationary distribution of X, and suppose X is reversible. We have that 7; pj; = Pit;
for alli, j, and furthermore z; > 0 for all i. Hence

Uj Pij Pik Pki = Pji%lj PjkPki = Pji Pkj Mk Pki = Pji Pkj PikTi

as required when n = 3. A similar calculation is valid when n > 3.

Suppose conversely that the given display holds for all finite sequences of states. Sum over all
values of the subsequence j2,..., jn—1 to deduce that p;j(n — 1) pji = pij pji(n — 1), where i = jy,
J = jn. Take the limit as n — oo to obtain 2; pj; = pjj 7; as required for time-reversibility.

3. With a the stationary distribution of X, look for a stationary distribution v of Y of the form

{ chu; ifi ZC,
y=

cm fi EC.

There are four cases.

(a) i€C, jf €C: vigij = cui Ppiy = CBN; Pji = Y;Q;i;

(b) i, f EC: viqij = CN; Pij = CN; Pji = VjQji.

(c) 1g C, J EC: vigy = cB Piy = CBX; Pji = VjQji,

(d) i,j €C: vigij = cB pij = CB; Dji = Vj Qji-

Hence the modified chain is reversible in equilibrium with stationary distribution v, when

In the limit as 6 | 0, the chain Y never leaves the set C once it has arrived in it.

4. Only if the period is 2, because of the detailed balance equations.

5. With Yn = Xn — 4m,
E(Y¥n) = E(Qn—1) + E(Xn — Xn-1)

= 8, +8 { (1 _ Xn=1

Now iterate.

6. (a) The distribution 7; = 8/(@ + 8), m2 = a/(a + B) satisfies the detailed balance equations,
so this chain is reversible.
(b) By symmetry, the stationary distribution is 7 = G, 3 3), which satisfies the detailed balance

equations if and only if p = 3:

(c) This chain is reversible if and only if p = 5.
