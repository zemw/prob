Therefore >, P(An(€)) < 00, implying by the Borel-Cantelli lemma that (a.s.) only finitely many of

12. We require the solution to Laplace’s equation V2p =0, subject to the boundary condition

0 ifwedH,

pow) = {4 ifweG.

Look for a solution in polar coordinates of the form

io, ¢)

pr, 8) = S- r" {an sin(nO) + by cos(nd) }.

n=0

Certainly combinations having this form satisfy Laplace’s equation, and the boundary condition gives
that

The collection {sin(m6@), cos(m@) : m > 0} are orthogonal over (—z, 7). Multiply through («) by
sin(m@) and integrate over (—7z, 7) to obtain 7a, = {1 — cos(z7m)}/m, and similarly bo = 5 and

bm =O form > 1.
13. The joint density function of two independent N (0, t) random variables is (2nt)7! exp{—(x” +
y’) /(2t)}. Since this function is unchanged by rotations of the plane, it follows that the two coordi-

nates of the particle’s position are independent Wiener processes, regardless of the orientation of the
coordinate system. We may thus assume that / is the line x = d for some fixed positive d.

The particle is bound to visit the line / sooner or later, since P(W,(t) < d for allt) = 0. The
first-passage time T has density function

Frit) = =e , t>0.

Conditional on {T = t}, D = W2(T) is N(O, t). Therefore the density function of D is

giving that D/d has the Cauchy distribution.
The angle © = POR satisfies 9 = tan—!(D/d), whence
