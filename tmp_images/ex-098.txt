Martingales Exercises [7.5.2]-[7.7.4]

Let X,, X2,... be independent random variables having the uniform distribution on [0, 1], and let
Zm (i) be the number of the X;, X2,..., Xm which lie in the ith interval of the partition above. Show
that

n
i=1

satisfies m—! log Rm — —h almost surely as m — ov.

2. Recurrent events. Catastrophes occur at the times 7; , T,... where T) = X;+X2+---+X; and
the X; are independent identically distributed positive random variables. Let N(t) = max{n : Ty < t}
be the number of catastrophes which have occurred by time t. Prove that if E(X,) < oo then
N(t) > co and N(t)/t > 1/E(X1) as t > oo, almost surely.

3. Random walk. Let X,, X2,... be independent identically distributed random variables taking
values in the integers Z and having a finite mean. Show that the Markov chain S = {S,} given by
Sn = 21 X; is transient if E(X1) 4 0.

7.6 Exercise. Law of the iterated logarithm

1. A function ¢(x) is said to belong to the ‘upper class’ if, in the notation of this section, P(S, >
o(n)./n io.) = 0. A consequence of the law of the iterated logarithm is that ./a log log x is in the
upper class for all a > 2. Use the first Borel—Cantelli lemma to prove the much weaker fact that
o(x) = fo log x is in the upper class for all a > 2, in the special case when the X; are independent
N(O, 1) variables.

7.7 Exercises. Martingales
1. Let X1, X2,... be random variables such that the partial sums Sy = X,; + X2+---+ Xn
determine a martingale. Show that E(X;X;) = 0 if i ¥ j.

2. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation of a branching process with immigration, in which the
family sizes have mean jt (# 1) and the mean number of immigrants in each generation is m. Suppose
that E(Zg) < o, and show that

_ n

is a martingale with respect to a suitable sequence of random variables.

3. Let Xo, X1, Xz, ... bea sequence of random variables with finite means and satisfying E(X,,41 |
Xo, X1,---,Xn) = aXpn + bX,_; forn > 1, whereO < a,b < 1landa+b=1. Finda value of a
for which S, = aX», + Xy,_-1,n = 1, defines a martingale with respect to the sequence X.

4. Let X, be the net profit to the gambler of betting a unit stake on the nth play in a casino; the
Xn may be dependent, but the game is fair in the sense that E(X,41 | X1, X2,-.., Xn) = 0 for all
n. The gambler stakes Y on the first play, and thereafter stakes f,(X 1, X2,..., Xn) on the (n + 1)th
play, where f,, f2,... are given functions. Show that her profit after n plays is

n
Sn = >) Xi fi-1(X1, X2,---, Xi-1),

i=1

where fo = Y. Show further that the sequence S = {S,} satisfies the martingale condition E(S,+ |
X 1, X2,...,Xn) = Sn, n = 1, if Y is assumed to be known throughout.
