Random variables and their distributions

2.1 Exercises. Random variables

1. Let X be arandom variable on a given probability space, and let a € R. Show that

(i) aX is a random variable,

(ii) X — X = 0, the random variable taking the value 0 always, and X + X = 2X.
2. Arandom variable X has distribution function F. What is the distribution function of Y = aX +b,
where a and b are real constants?
3. A fair coin is tossed n times. Show that, under reasonable assumptions, the probability of exactly
k heads is (RG). What is the corresponding quantity when heads appears with probability p on
each toss?

4. Show that if F and G are distribution functions andO < 4 < 1 thenA F+(1 —A)G isa distribution
function. Is the product FG a distribution function?

5. Let F be a distribution function and r a positive integer. Show that the following are distribution
functions:

(a) F(x)’,

(b) 1-f1- FQ),

(ce) F(x) + {1 — F(x)} log{1 — F@)},
(d) {F(x) — 1}e + exp{1 — F(x)}.

2.2 Exercises. The law of averages

1. You wish to ask each of a large number of people a question to which the answer “yes” is
embarrassing. The following procedure is proposed in order to determine the embarrassed fraction of
the population. As the question is asked, a coin is tossed out of sight of the questioner. If the answer
would have been “no” and the coin shows heads, then the answer “yes” is given. Otherwise people
respond truthfully. What do you think of this procedure?

2. Acoinis tossed repeatedly and heads turns up on each toss with probability p. Let Hy, and Ty be
the numbers of heads and tails in n tosses. Show that, for « > 0,

1
P(2p—1-€ < “(Hin ~ Ty) <2p—-1 46) +1 asin —> oo.
n

3. Let {X;, :r > 1} be observations which are independent and identically distributed with unknown
distribution function F. Describe and justify a method for estimating F(x).
