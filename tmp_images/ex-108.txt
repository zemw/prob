8.5 Exercises. The Wiener process

1. Fora Wiener process W with W(0) = 0, show that

1 1
P(W(s) >0, Wi) > 0) =] + on sin~! ‘A fors <t.

Calculate P(W(s) > 0, W(t) > 0, Wi) > 0) whens <t <u.
2. Let W be a Wiener process. Show that, for s < t < u, the conditional distribution of W(t) given
W(s) and W(w) is normal

N (S —-)W()+t-s)Wiu) u—-net— >)

u—s “u—S

Deduce that the conditional correlation between W(t) and W(u), given W(s) and W(v), where s <

t<u<v,is
(v —u)(t —s)
(v-t)u—s)
3. For what values of a and b is aW, + bW2 a standard Wiener process, where W, and W) are

independent standard Wiener processes?

4. Show that a Wiener process W with variance parameter o? has finite quadratic variation, which
is to say that

n—1
Vw G + Wt/n) — W(jt/n)}* eS 07t asn > o.
j=0

5. Let W be a Wiener process. Which of the following define Wiener processes?
(a) —W(t), (b) VW), (© W(2t) — We).

8.7 Problems

1. Let {Z,} be a sequence of uncorrelated real-valued variables with zero means and unit variances,
and define the ‘moving average’

r
Yn = So oi Zn-is
=0

for constants a9, a1, ..., @,-. Show that Y is stationary and find its autocovariance function.

2. Let {Z,} be a sequence of uncorrelated real-valued variables with zero means and unit variances.
Suppose that {Y,,} is an ‘autoregressive’ stationary sequence in that it satisfies Y, = a@Y¥,_1 + Zn,
—oo <n < on, for some real a satisfying |a| < 1. Show that Y has autocovariance function
c(m) = al! /(1 — a).

3. Let {X,} be a sequence of independent identically distributed Bernoulli variables, each taking
values 0 and 1 with probabilities 1 — p and p respectively. Find the mass function of the renewal
process N(r) with interarrival times {Xp}.

4. Customers arrive in a shop in the manner of a Poisson process with parameter 1. There are
infinitely many servers, and each service time is exponentially distributed with parameter 4. Show
that the number Q(t) of waiting customers at time ¢ constitutes a birth-death process. Find its
stationary distribution.
