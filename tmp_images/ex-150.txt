Problems Solutions [1.7.3]-[1.8.2]

3. First method: Suppose that the coin is being tossed by a special machine which is not switched
off when the walker is absorbed. If the machine ever produces N heads in succession, then either the
game finishes at this point or it is already over. From Exercise (1.3.2), such a sequence of N heads
must (with probability one) occur sooner or later.

Alternative method: Write down the difference equations for p;, the probability the game finishes at
O having started at k, and for px, the corresponding probability that the game finishes at N; actually
these two difference equations are the same, but the respective boundary conditions are different.
Solve these equations and add their solutions to obtain the total 1.

4. Itisa tricky question. One of the present authors is in agreement, since if P(A | C) > P(B | C)
and P(A | C°) > P(B {| C°) then
P(A) = P(A | C)P(C) + P(A | COP(CS)
> P(B | CYP(C) + P(B | CYP(CS) = PCB).
The other author is more suspicious of the question, and points out that there is a difficulty arising

from the use of the word ‘you’. In Example (1.7.10), Simpson’s paradox, whilst drug I is preferable
to drug II for both males and females, it is drug I that wins overall.

5. Let Lx be the label of the kth card. Then, using symmetry,

P(Lg =m) 1/1
P(L = m| Le > Ly for <r <k) = 5 a == / gp =k/m.

1.8 Solutions to problems

1. (a) Method I: There are 36 equally likely outcomes, and just 10 of these contain exactly one six.
The answer is therefore 19 = ze

Method IT: Since the throws have independent outcomes,

P(first is 6, second is not 6) = P(first is 6)P(second is not 6) = é : 3 = >.
There is an equal probability of the event {first is not 6, second is 6}.
(b) A die shows an odd number with probability i. by independence, P(both odd) = I . i = i
(c) Write S for the sum, and {i, 7} for the event that the first is i and the second 7. Then P(S = 4) =
P(1, 3) + P(2, 2) + PG, 1) = #.
(d) Similarly

P(S divisible by 3) = P(S = 3) + P(S = 6) + P(S = 9) + P(S = 12)
= {PC, 2) + P(2, 1)}
+ {PC, 5) + P(2, 4) + PG, 3) + PG, 2) + PG, 1}
+ {PG, 6) + P(4, 5) + PCS, 4) + P(6, 3)} + PC, 6)

2. (a) By independence, P(n — 1 tails, followed by a head) = 2~”.

(b) If n is odd, P(# heads = # tails) = 0; #A denotes the cardinality of the set A. If n is even, there
are (n2) sequences of outcomes with hn heads and 5n tails. Any given sequence of heads and tails

has probability 2~”; therefore P(# heads = # tails) = 27” (nj2)-
