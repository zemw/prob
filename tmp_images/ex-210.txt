4.9 Solutions. Multivariate normal distribution

1. Since V is symmetric, there exists a non-singular matrix M such that M’ = M7~! and V =
MAM7!, where A is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries the eigenvalues Aj, A2,..., An of V.

1 1
Let A2 be the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries ./A1, /A2,...,-/An; A2 is well defined since
1
V is non-negative definite. Writing W = MA2M’, we have that W = W’ and also

Ww = (MA2M~!)(MA2M~!) =MAM-!=V

1
as required. Clearly W is non-singular if and only if A2 is non-singular. This happens if and only if
A; > 0 for all i, which is to say that V is positive definite.

2. By Theorem (4.9.6), ¥ has the multivariate normal distribution with mean vector 0 and covariance
matrix
w-'vw-! = wo! ow4yw-l =

3. Clearly Y = (K — pa’ + pra’ where a = (a1, @2,..., an). Using Theorem (4.9.6) as in the
previous solution, (X — yz)a’ is univariate normal with mean 0 and variance aVa’. Hence Y is normal
with mean ja’ and variance aVa’.

4. Make the transformation u = x + y, v = x — y, with inverse x = su +v) y= 5(u — v), SO
that |J| = 5. The exponent of the bivariate normal density function is

ny ay Eg ay 2
apy * 2oxy + y*) 4nd (L—p)+v°(1+ p)},

and therefore U = X + Y, V = X — Y have joint density

flu, v) 1 ex uw v?
u,v) = - - ,
4nJi-p2?| 40 +0) 40—p)

whence U and V are independent with respective distributions N(0, 2(1 + e)) and N(O, 2(1 — ¢)).

5. That Y is N(O, 1) follows by showing that P(Y < y) = P(X < y) for each of the cases y < ~a,
ly| <a, y>a.
Secondly,

p(a) = E(XY) = a x°o(x) dx — [. x°o(x) dx — [ Pomax =1-— af x(x) dx.
