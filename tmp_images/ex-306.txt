The vector 7(k) = (7;(k) : i € S) satisfies P(K)H = 7(k), by Lemma (6.4.5), where H is the
transition matrix of the jump chain Z. That is to say,

whence 5°; ¥(k)gij = O for all j € S. If ux = 57; 4K) < 00, the vector (y; (k)/ px) is a stationary
distribution for X, whence 2; = y;(k)/x for alli. Setting i = k we deduce that zy = 1/(gz tg).

12, Define the generator G by gj; = —vj, gij = vj4;;, so that the imbedded chain has transition
matrix H. A root of the equation xG = 90 satisfies

O= So migiy = —ajyj t+ SO) Guvhiy

whence the vector ¢ = (2;v; : j € S) satisfies ¢ = €H. Therefore = av, which is to say that
jv; = av;,for some constant a. Now v; > Ofor all j, sothat 7; = a, which implies that yj my #1.
Therefore the continuous-time chain X with generator G has no stationary distribution.

where pj = A;/(Aj + ui). Also P(Zp41 = 1 | Zn = 0) = 1.
2. The transition matrix H = (h;;) of Z is given by

To find the stationary distribution of Y, either solve the equation # = 2Q, or look for a solution of
the detailed balance equations mh; ;41 = 2i41hj+1,;. Following the latter route, we have that
