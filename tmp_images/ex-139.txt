2. Consider a portfolio which, at time rt, holds &(t, S) units of stock and w(t, S) units of bond, and
assume these quantities depend only on the values of S,, for 0 < u < t. Find the function y such that
the portfolio is self-financing in the three cases:

(a) &(¢, S) = 1 for allt, S,

(b) &@, S) = Sz,
) &tt y= fs dv
(c = R py dv.

3. Suppose the stock price S; is itself a Wiener process and the interest rate r equals 0, so that a
unit of bond has unit value for all time. In the notation of Exercise (2), which of the following define
self-financing portfolios?

(a) €(¢t, S) = w@, S) = 1 for all ¢, S,

(b) (1, 8) = 2S;, W(t, S) = -S? -1,

(c) &(t, S) = —-t, Wit, S) = fg Ss ds,

) &(t,5) = fo Ssds, W(t, S) = — fg S? ds.

4. An ‘American call option’ differs from a European call option in that it may be exercised by the
buyer at any time up to the expiry date. Show that the value of the American call option is the same
as that of the corresponding European call option, and that there is no advantage to the holder of such
an option to exercise it strictly before its expiry date.

5. Show that the Black-Scholes value at time 0 of the European call option is an increasing function
of the initial stock price, the exercise date, the interest rate, and the volatility, and is a decreasing
function of the strike price.

1. Let G be the closed sphere with radius € and centre at the origin of R@ where d > 3. Let W bea
d-dimensional Wiener process starting from W(0) = w ¢ G. Show that the probability that W visits
Gis (e/r)4-2, where r = |w|.

2. Let G be an infinite connected graph with finite vertex degrees. Let A, be the set of vertices x
which are distance n from 0 (that is, the shortest path from x to 0 contains n edges), and let Ny be
the total number of edges joining pairs x, y of vertices with x € An, y € Ayn+1. Show that a random
walk on G is persistent if }7; i = 0.

3. Let G be aconnected graph with finite vertex degrees, and let H be a connected subgraph of G.
Show that a random walk on 7 is persistent if a random walk on G is persistent, but that the converse

is not generally true.

1. Let W beastandard Wiener process, that is, a process with independent increments and continuous
sample paths such that W(s +1) — W(s) is N(O, t) fort > 0. Let a be a positive constant. Show that:

(a) aW(t /o) is a standard Wiener process,
(b) W(t +a) — W(q) is a standard Wiener process,
(c) the process V, given by V(t) = tW(1/t) for t > 0, V(O) = 0, is a standard Wiener process.

2. Let X = {X(t) : t > 0} be a Gaussian process with continuous sample paths, zero means, and
autocovariance function e(s, t) = u(s)v(t) for s < ¢ where u and v are continuous functions. Suppose
