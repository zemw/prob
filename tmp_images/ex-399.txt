[11.8.6]-[11.8.7] Solutions Queues

Now Mz(s) is non-decreasing in s, and therefore it is the value with the minus sign. The density
function of B may be found by inverting the moment generating function; see Feller (1971, p. 482),
who has also an alternative derivation of Mg.

As for the mean and variance, either differentiate Mz, or differentiate («). Following the latter
route, we obtain the following relations involving M (= Mp):

21MM’ +M+(s—A-—p)M’ =0,
24MM" +22(M’)? + 2M’! +(s —A —p)M” =0.

Set s = Oto obtain M’(0) = (u—A)7! and M” (0) = 2(4—A)~3, whence the claims are immediate.

6. (i) This question is closely related to Exercise (11.3.1). With the same notation as in that solution,
we have that

(*) On+1 = An + Qn — h(Qn)

where h(x) = min{1, x}. Taking expectations, we obtain P(Q, > 0) = E(Ay) where
oO
B(An) = |" B(An | $=5)dFs(6) = AB(S) = p,

and S is a typical service time. Square (*) and take expectations to obtain

p(1 — 2p) + E(A?, 1)
2(1 — p)

’

where E(A2) is found (as above) to equal p + 07E(S2).

Gi) If a customer waits for time W and is served for time S, he leaves behind him a queue-length
which is Poisson with parameter A(W + 5S). In equilibrium, its mean satisfies AE(W + S) = E(Qn),
whence E(W) is given as claimed.

(iii) E(W) is a minimum when E(S) is minimized, which occurs when S is concentrated at its mean.
Deterministic service times minimize mean waiting time.

7. Condition on arrivals in (¢, ¢+-A). If there are no arrivals, then W,+, < x ifandonly if W; < x-+h.
If there is an arrival, and his service time is S, then W;,, < x if andonly if W, < x+A—S. Therefore

x+h
F(aj;t+h) =(1—-AA)F+A;1) +an | F(x th—s;t)dFs(s) + o(h).
0

Subtract F (x; t), divide by A, and take the limit as h | 0, to obtain the differential equation.
We take Laplace-—Stieltjes transforms. Integrating by parts, for @ < 0,

| e°* dh(x) = —h(0) — 0{My (6) — H(0)},
(0,00)
| e** dH (x) = My (6) — H(0),
(0,00)
| e%* dP(U +S < x) = My(6)Ms(),
(0,00)

and therefore

0 = —h(0) — 0{My @) — H(0)} +AH (0) +AMy @){Ms(@) — 1}.
