[1.5.4]-[1.7.2] Solutions Events and their probabilities

so that P((; $;) = [Ij P(S)).

4. Suppose |A| = a, |B| = b, |AM B| = c, and A and B are independent. Then P(AN B) =
P(A)P(B), which is to say that c/p = (a/p)- (b/p), and hence ab = pc. If ab # O then p | ab
(i.e., p divides ab). However, p is prime, and hence either p | a or p | b. Therefore, either A = Q or
B = Q (or both).

5. (a) Flip two coins; let A be the event that the first shows H, let B be the event that the second
shows H, and let C be the event that they show the same. Then A and B are independent, but not
conditionally independent given C.

(b) Roll two dice; let A be the event that the smaller is 3, let B be the event that the larger is 6, and let
C be the event that the smaller score is no more than 3, and the larger is 4 or more. Then A and B are
conditionally independent given C, but not independent.

(c) The definitions are equivalent if P(C) = 1.

6 (a) <4

7. (a)P(AN B)= 3 = =}. 1 = P(A)P(B), and (BNC) = =}-} = P(B)P(C).

(b) PAN C) =0 4 P(ADP(C).

(c) Only in the trivial cases when children are either almost surely boys or almost surely girls.
(d) No.

8 No. P(all alike) = 4.

9. P(ist shows r and sum is 7) = % = é . é = P(1st shows r)P(sum is 7).

1.7 Solutions. Worked examples

1. Write EF for the event that there is an open road from E to F, and EF® for the complement of
this event; write E < F if there is an open route from E to F, and E # F if there is none. Now
{A < C} = ABM BC, so that

P(AB,A GC) P(AB,B¢C)__(1— p?)p?
PAC)  1-PASC) 1-(1— p2)?’

P(AB| A #C) =

By a similar calculation (or otherwise) in the second case, one obtains the same answer:

(1 — p?)p? _ (= p*)p*

PAB | A ©) = 7G na, ad -p) 17d py

2. Let A be the event of exactly one ace, and KK be the event of exactly two kings. Then P(A |
KK) = P(A 1 KK)/P(KK). Now, by counting acceptable combinations,

moan ((QCI/ C3} me (GEG)

so the required probability is

(616/000):
