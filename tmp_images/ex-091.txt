[6.15.40]-[6.15.46] Exercises Markov chains

40. Perturbations continued. Suppose for convenience in Problem (6.15.39) that the displacements
have a continuous distribution function and finite mean, and that d = 1. Suppose also that you are
at the origin originally, and you move to a in the perturbed process. Let Lp be the number of points
formerly on your left that are now on your right, and Ry, the number of points formerly on your right
that are now on your left. Show that E(Lp) = E(R,) if and only if a = jz where yz is the mean
displacement of a particle.

Deduce that if cars enter the start of a long road at the instants of a Poisson process, having
independent identically distributed velocities, then, if you travel at the average speed, in the long run
the rate at which you are overtaken by other cars equals the rate at which you overtake other cars.

41, Ants enter a kitchen at the instants of a Poisson process N of rate A; they each visit the pantry
and then the sink, and leave. The rth ant spends time X; in the pantry and Y, in the sink (and X; + Y,
in the kitchen altogether), where the vectors V, = (X,, Y,) and Vs are independent for r ~ s. At
time t = 0 the kitchen is free of ants. Find the joint distribution of the numbers A(t) of ants in the
pantry and B(t) of ants in the sink at time t. Now suppose the ants arrive in pairs at the times of the
Poisson process, but then separate to behave independently as above. Find the joint distribution of the
numbers of ants in the two locations.

42. Let {X, : r > 1} be independent exponential random variables with parameter 1, and set S, =

yor, Xr. Show that:

(a) Ye = Sx/Sn, 1 < k <n —1, have the same distribution as the order statistics of independent
variables {U; : 1 < k <n — 1} which are uniformly distributed on (0, 1),

(b) Z, = Xx/Sn, 1 < k < n, have the same joint distribution as the coordinates of a point
(U,,..., Un) chosen uniformly at random on the simplex an ur = 1, uy > O for all r.

43. Let X be a discrete-time Markov chain with a finite number of states and transition matrix
P = (pij) where p;; > 0 for alli, 7. Show that there exists 1 € (0, 1) such that | pj; (2) — m;| < A”,
where w is the stationary distribution.

44. Under the conditions of Problem (6.15.43), let V;(n) = a, T;x,=i} be the number of visits of
the chain to i before time n. Show that

45. Conditional entropy. Let A and B = (Bo, By,..., Bn) be a discrete random variable and
vector, respectively. The conditional entropy of A with respect to B is defined as H(A | B) =
E(E{—log f(A | B)|B}) where f(a | b) = P(A =a | B=b). Let X be an aperiodic Markov chain
on a finite state space. Show that

H(Xn41 | Xo, X1..- Xn) = H(Xn41 | Xn),

and that
A(Xns1 | Xn) > —Somi SS) py log pij asn > 00,

if X is aperiodic with a unique stationary distribution w.

46. Coupling. Let X and Y be independent persistent birth-death processes with the same parameters
(and no explosions). It is not assumed that Xg = Yo. Show that:
