[6.12.2]-[6.12.4] Solutions Markov chains

whence j4i9 = (u% + A)/(u — A). Since each sojourn is exponentially distributed with parameter
iu +A, the result follows by an easy calculation. See also Theorem (11.3.17).

2. We apply the method of Theorem (6.12.11) with

the probability generating function of the population size at time u in a simple birth process. In the
absence of disasters, the probability generating function of the ensuing population size at time v is

A(s,v) = exp (» [ tens. u) — 11du) ={s+(1 = ser,

The individuals alive at time ¢ arose subsequent to the most recent disaster at time t — D, where D
has density function be *, x > 0. Therefore,

3. The mean number of descendants after time t of a single progenitor at time 0 is e@~)".. The
expected number due to the arrival of a single individual at a uniformly distributed time in the interval

The aggregate effect at time x of N earlier arrivals is the same, by Theorem (6.12.7), as that of N
arrivals at independent times which are uniformly distributed on [0, x]. Since E(V) = vx, the mean
population size at time x is v[eA-#)* — 1]/(A — w). The most recent disaster occurred at time t — D,
where D has density function be7o* , x > 0, and it follows that

This is bounded as t > oo if and only if6 > A — w.

4. Let N be the number of clients who arrive during the interval [0, t]. Conditional on the event
{N = n}, the arrival times have, by Theorem (6.12.7), the same joint distribution as n independent
variables chosen uniformly from [0, t]. The probability that an arrival at a uniform time in [0, t] is
still in service at time f is B = fol — G(t —x)]t7! dx, whence, conditional on {N = 7}, the total
number M still in service is bin(x, 8). Therefore,

B (eM) = B(B(e™ | N)) = B((Be? +1—f)") = Gy Be? +1 - py =e,

whence M has the Poisson distribution with parameter ABt = A fo — G(x)Jdx. Note that this
parameter approaches XE(S) as t — oo.
