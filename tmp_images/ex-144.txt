Events and their probabilities

1.2 Solutions. Events as sets

1. (a) Leta € (UA;)°. Thena ¢ UAj, so that a € Af for all i. Hence (UJ A;)° € () Af.
Conversely, if a € (| Aj, then a ¢ A; for every i. Hence a ¢ \) A;, and so (| Af © (U A;)°. The
first De Morgan law follows.

(b) Applying part (a) to the family {Af : i € I}, we obtain that (Uj; Ag)° = 11;(A9)S = 1); Ai-
Taking the complement of each side yields the second law.

2. Clearly

(i) AN B= (ASU BY),

(ii) A\ B= AN BS = (AS UB),
(iii) AA B= (A\ B)U(B\ A) = (ASU BYU (AU BY.

Now F is closed under the operations of countable unions and complements, and therefore each of
these sets lies in F.

3. Letusnumberthe players 1, 2, ...,2” in the order in which they appear in the initial table of draws.
The set of victors in the first round is a point in the space V, = {1,2} x {3,4} x --. x {2" —1,2”}.
Renumbering these victors in the same way as done for the initial draw, the set of second-round
victors can be thought of as a point in the space V,,_1, and so on. The sample space of all possible
outcomes of the tournament may therefore be taken to be V, x V,_1 x +--+ x Vj, a Set containing
g2rtg2"? |. ol — 92"—1 points.

Should we be interested in the ultimate winner only, we may take as sample space the set

{1,2,...,2"} of all possible winners.

4, We must check that % satisfies the definition of a o-field:

(a) @ € F, and therefore @ = ON B € G,

(b) if Ay, Ag, ... € F, then Uj, (A; 9 B) = (U; Ai) NB € G,

(c) if A € F, then A° € ¥ so that B\ (AN B) = ASN Be §.

Note that %, is a o-field of subsets of B but not a o-field of subsets of Q, since C € % does not imply
that C° = Q\ Ce §.

5. (a), (b), and (d) are identically true; (c) is true if and only if A CC.

1.3 Solutions. Probability

1. (i) We have (using the fact that P is a non-decreasing set function) that

P(AM B) = P(A) + P(B) — P(AU B) > P(A) + P(B) — 1 = %.
