where we have used the combinatorial identity $77 9 ("5") = (et). To see this, either use

the simple identity (,*,) + (7) = (* ry repeatedly, or argue as follows. Changing the order of

by the (negative) binomial theorem. Equating coefficients of x”, we obtain the required identity.

Second method. Writing m(b, r) for the mean in question, and conditioning on the colour of the first

ball, we find that

With appropriate boundary conditions and a little effort, one may obtain the result.

Third method. Withdraw all the balls, and let N; be the number of red balls drawn between the ith and
(i + 1)th blue ball (No = N, and Nz is defined analogously). Think of a possible ‘colour sequence’
as comprising r reds, split by b blues into b + 1 red sequences. There is a one-one correspondence
between the set of such sequences with No = i, Nm = j (for given i, j,m) and the set of such
sequences with No = j, Nm = i; just interchange the ‘Oth’ red run with the mth red run. In particular
E(No) = E(Nm) for all m. Now No + Nj +---+ Np =r, 80 that E(Nm) = r/(b + 1), whence the
claim is immediate.

(c) We use the notation just introduced. In addition, let B, be the number of blue balls remaining after
the removal of the last red ball. The length of the last ‘colour run’ is Np + B;, only one of which is
non-zero. The answer is therefore r/(b + 1) + b/(r + 1), by the argument of the third solution to part
(b).

14. (a) We have that E(X;,) = pz and var(X;,) = px(1 — px), and the claims follow in the usual way,
the first by the linearity of E and the second by the independence of the X;; see Theorems (3.3.8) and
(3.3.11).

(b) Let s = 5°, pg, and let Z be a random variable taking each of the values p;, p2,..., Pn with
equal probability n~!. Now E(Z”) — E(Z)* = var(Z) > 0, so that
