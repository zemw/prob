Problems Solutions [13.12.8]-[13.12.8]

The mean value of the final term is, by the Cauchy—Schwarz inequality, no larger than

Combine this with (*) to obtain

implying that 77°, Mon-1 9n < 00 a.8. Therefore the series which defines W converges uniformly
with probability 1 (along a subsequence), and hence W has (a.s.) continuous sample paths.

Certainly W is a Gaussian process since W(t) is the sum of normal variables (see Problem
(7.11.19)). Furthermore E(W (t)) = 0, and

since the X; are independent with zero means and unit variances. It is an exercise in Fourier analysis
to deduce that cov(W(s), W(t)) = min{s, f}.

Let g(t, y | d) be the N(d, ft) density function, and note that g(-,- | d) satisfies («) for any
‘source’ d. Let

a series which converges absolutely and is differentiable term by term. Since each summand satisfies
(*), so does the sum. Now g(0, y) is a combination of Dirac delta functions, one at each multiple of 2b.
Only one such multiple lies in [—b, b], and hence g(y, 0) = dg. Also, setting y = b, the contributions
from the sources at —2(k — 1)b and 2kb cancel, so that g(t, b) = 0. Similarly g(t, —b) = 0, and
therefore g is the required solution.

Here is an alternative method. Look for the solution to («) of the form e~*"" sin{ snr (y + b)/b};

such a sine function vanishes when |y| = b. Substitute into («) to obtain Ay, = n272 / (8b2). A linear
combination of such functions has the form
