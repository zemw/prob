Problems Solutions [4.14.28]-[4.14.31]
(b) We have, with Z = |X + Y|,

E(Z?) =E(Z- Z?-1) < E(X|Z?-!) + E(\y|Z?~})
< {E|X?|}1/P (e(Z?)}1/4 + (EY? |y/? (E(ZP)} 1/4

by Hélder’s inequality, where p~! + q—! = 1. Divide by {E(Z?)}!/@ to get the result.

28. Apply the Cauchy—Schwarz inequality to |Z [20-@) and |Z| p(b+a) where 0 < a < b, to obtain
{E|Z?|}2 < E|Z°-4| £|Z°+4|. Now take logarithms: 2g(b) < g(b — a) + g(b +a) for0 <a <b.
Also g(p) > g(0) = 1 as p | 0 (by dominated convergence). These two properties of g imply that
g is convex on intervals of the form [0, M) if it is finite on this interval. The reference to dominated
convergence may be avoided by using Holder instead of Cauchy—Schwarz.

By convexity, g(x)/x is non-decreasing in x, and therefore g(r)/r > g(s)/s if0 <s <r.

29. Assume that X, Y, Z are jointly continuously distributed with joint density function f. Then

f(@, y,2) dx.

E(X|Y¥=y,Z=o= dx =
(X|¥=y.Z=2) [sfarzely.2 ee [ae

Hence

E{B(X1Y,Z)|¥=y}= [BX =y,Z= ofall yz

Alternatively, use the general properties of conditional expectation as laid down in Section 4.6.

30. The first car to arrive in a car park of length x + 1 effectively divides it into two disjoint parks
of length Y and x — Y, where Y is the position of the car’s leftmost point. Now Y is uniform on
[0, x], and the formula follows by conditioning on Y. Laplace transforms are the key to exploring the
asymptotic behaviour of m(x)/x as x > oo.

31. (a) If the needle were of length d, the answer would be 2/7 as before. Think about the new needle
as being obtained from a needle of length d by dividing it into two parts, an ‘active’ part of length L,
and a ‘passive’ part of length d — L, and then counting only intersections involving the active part.
The chance of an ‘active intersection’ is now (2/7)(L/d) = 2L/(ad).

(b) As in part (a), the angle between the line and the needle is independent of the distance between
the line and the needle’s centre, each having the same distribution as before. The answer is therefore
unchanged.

(c) The following argument lacks a little rigour, which may be supplied as a consequence of the
statement that S has finite length. For € > 0, let x1, x2,..., x, be points on S, taken in order along
S, such that xo and x, are the endpoints of S, and |xj41 — x;| < € forO <i <n; |x — y| denotes
the Euclidean distance from x to y. Let J; be the straight line segment joining x; to xj+1, and let J;
be the indicator function of {J; 1A 4 @). If € is sufficiently small, the total number of intersections
between Jp U Jy U-++U J,_1 and S has mean
