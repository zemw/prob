constitutes a martingale if cosA 4 0.

Let a and b be positive integers. Show that the time T until absorption at one of two absorbing
barriers at —a and b satisfies

_py _ cos{5a(b — a)}
B({eosa™") = cos{a(b +a)}' < Sora

6. Let {S, :n > 0} bea simple symmetric random walk on the positive and negative integers, with
So = 0. For each of the three following random variables, determine whether or not it is a stopping
time and find its mean:

U =min{n >5:S_,=Sp-5+5}, V=U-5, W=min{n: S, = 1).

7. LetS, =a+>°?_, Xr beasimple symmetric random walk. The walk stops at the earliest time T
when it reaches either of the two positions 0 or K whereO < a < K. Show that My, = 0 Sr—- 43
is a martingale and deduce that E(S~/_9 Sy) = 4(K? — a?)a +a.

8. Gambler’s ruin. Let X; be independent random variables each equally likely to take the values

+1, and let T = min{n : S, € {—a,b}}. Verify the conditions of the optional stopping theorem
(12.5.1) for the martingale Ss? — nand the stopping time T.

12.7 Exercises. Backward martingales and continuous-time martingales

1. Let X be a continuous-time Markov chain with finite state space S and generator G. Let 7 =
{n(@i) : i € S} be a root of the equation Gy’ = 0. Show that 4(X(t)) constitutes a martingale with
respect to F; = o ({X(u) : u < t}).

2. Let N be a Poisson process with intensity A and N(O) = 0, and let Tz = min{r : N(t) = a},
where a is a positive integer. Assuming that E{exp(yTz)} < oo for sufficiently small positive w, use
the optional stopping theorem to show that var(Tz) = an,

3. Let S, = ee Xy, m <n, where the X; are independent and identically distributed with finite
mean. Denote by U;, U2, ... , Un the order statistics of n independent variables which are uniformly
distributed on (0, t), and set U,,1 = t. Show that Rm = Sm/Um+i, 0 < m <n, is a backward
martingale with respect to a suitable sequence of o-fields, and deduce that

P(Rm = 1 for some m <n| Sp = y) < min{y/t, 1}.

12.9 Problems

1. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation of a branching process with immigration in which the
mean family size is jz (4 1) and the mean number of immigrants per generation is m. Show that

_ 1— pe”
Yn =U {zn mi}

defines a martingale.

2. In an age-dependent branching process, each individual gives birth to a random number of off-
spring atrandom times. At time 0, there exists a single progenitor who has N children at the subsequent
