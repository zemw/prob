[4.12.4]-[4.13.6] Exercises Continuous random variables

4. Maximal coupling. Show for discrete random variables X, Y that P(X = Y) < 1—- sary (X,Y),
where dry denotes total variation distance.

5. Maximal coupling continued. Show that equality is possible in the inequality of Exercise
(4.12.4) in the following sense. For any pair X, Y of discrete random variables, there exists a pair X’,
Y’ having the same marginal distributions as X, Y such that P(X’ = Y’) = 1 — ary (X, Y).

6. Let X and Y be indicator variables with EX = p, EY = q. What is the maximum possible value
of P(X = Y), as a function of p, g? Explain how X, Y need to be distributed in order that P(X = Y)
be: (a) maximized, (b) minimized.

4.13 Exercises. Geometrical probability

With apologies to those who prefer their exercises better posed ...

1. Pick two points A and B independently at random on the circumference of a circle C with centre
O and unit radius. Let I be the length of the perpendicular from O to the line AB, and let © be the
angle AB makes with the horizontal. Show that (IT, @) has joint density

2. Let Sy; and Sz be disjoint convex shapes with boundaries of length b(S,), b(S2), as illustrated
in the figure beneath. Let b(H) be the length of the boundary of the convex hull of S; and 5S,
incorporating their exterior tangents, and b(X) the length of the crossing curve using the interior
tangents to loop round S$; and Sj. Show that the probability that a random line crossing Sj also
crosses S2 is {b(X) — b(H)}/b(S1). (See Example (4.13.2) for an explanation of the term ‘random
line’.) How is this altered if S; and $5 are not disjoint?

The circles are the shapes S, and S$). The shaded regions are denoted A and B, and b(X) is

the sum of the perimeter lengths of A and B.
3. Let S, and Sz be convex figures such that Sy C S;. Show that the probability that two independent
random lines 4, and Az, crossing S;, meet within S> is 27r|S>| /b(S1)?, where |S2| is the area of Sz
and b(S}) is the length of the boundary of S;. (See Example (4.13.2) for an explanation of the term
‘random line’.)

4. Let Z be the distance between two points picked independently at random in a disk of radius a.
Show that E(Z) = 128a/(45s), and E(Z”) = a?.

5. Pick two points A and B independently at random in a ball with centre O. Show that the probability
that the angle AOB is obtuse is 3. Compare this with the corresponding result for two points picked
at random in a circle.

6. A triangle is formed by A, B, and a point P picked at random in a set S with centre of gravity G.
Show that E/ABP| = |ABG].
