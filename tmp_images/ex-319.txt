[6.15.17]-[6.15.19] Solutions Markov chains

giving that the chain is reversible.
(b) Let S = {1, 2} and

o=(G 4)

where af > 0. The chain is uniform with stationary distribution

(c) Let X be a birth-death process with birth rates 4; and death rates j4;. The stationary distribution
satisfies

1 — AQMO =O, Wet MeL — ThA = RAR — WR—-1AK-1 fork > 1.

Therefore x4.) 4g4-1 = Ax for k = O, the conditions for reversibility.

17. Consider the continuous-time chain with generator

G= (;’ B )
y —¥Y
It is a standard calculation (Exercise (6.9.1)) that the associated semigroup satisfies

_( y+Bhe) BO-AW)
(B+ Y)Pr = (ra —h@) B+yhit) )

where h(t) = e+”), Now Py = P if and only if y + Bh(1) = B + yh(1) = a(B + y), which is
to say that B = y = -4 log(2a — 1), a solution which requires that a > 5.
