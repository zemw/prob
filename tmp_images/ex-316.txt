which, by an application of Stirling’s formula, is no bigger than Cn 2 for some constant C. Hence
yn P(Kan = 9) < 00, so that the origin is transient.

10. No. The line of ancestors of any cell-state is a random walk in three dimensions. The difference
between two such lines of ancestors is also a type of random walk, which in three dimensions is
transient.

11. There are one or two absorbing states according as whether one or both of @ and 8 equal zero. If
aB # 0, the chain is irreducible and persistent. It is periodic if and only if a = 6 = 1, in which case

it has period 2.
( B a } f )

If0 < af < | then
is the stationary distribution. There are various ways of calculating P”; see Exercise (6.3.3) for
example. In this case the answer is given by

n_i__y,_pynf & —a@ Ba).
(a + p)P" =(1-a—f) (%, r+ a“)

proof by induction. Hence

The chain is reversible in equilibrium if and only if 21 pj2 = 72,21, which is to say that aB = Ba!

for 0 < i < N. This process is a birth-death process in discrete time, and by Exercise (6.5.1) is

13. (a) The chain X is irreducible; all states are therefore of the same type. The state 0 is aperiodic,
and so therefore is every other state. Suppose that Xp = 0, and let T be the time of the first return to
0. Then P(T > n) = aga) ---a,—1 = bn for n > 1, so that 0 is persistent if and only if b, —> 0 as
