exists a.s. and in mean. Now U = lim supy_, 99 (n7} > 7 X;) is invariant, since

implying that U(w) = U(Tw) as. It follows that U is £-measurable, and it is the case that Z = U
a.s. Take conditional expectations of («), given £, to obtain U = E(X | £) as.

If T is ergodic, then £ is trivial, so that E(X | £) is a.s. constant; therefore E(X | £) = E(X) as.
14. If (a, b) < [0, 1), then T~!(a, b) = (5a, 5b)U(4 + 5a, 5 +40), and therefore T is measurable.
Secondly,

P(T~\(a,b)) = 2(4b — $a) = b —a = P((a, b)),

so that T~! preserves the measure of intervals. The intervals generate B, and it is then standard that
T7! preserves the measures of all events.

Let A be invariant, in that A= T~!A. Let0 < @ < 53 it is easily seen that T(w) = T(w + 3):
Therefore co € A if and only if @ + 5 € A, implying that AN[4, 1) = 4 + {AN[O, 5)}; hence

P(ANE)= 4P(A)=P(A)P(E) for E = [0, 5), [9, D).

This proves that A is independent of both [0, 5) and [5 , 1). Asimilar proof gives that A is independent

of any set E which is, for some n, the union of intervals of the form [k2™ , (k+1)2~") forO < k < 2".
It is a fundamental result of measure theory that there exists a sequence FE), E2, ... of events such that

(a) Ey, is of the above form, for each n,
(b) P(A A E,) > Oasn > o0.
Choosing the £, accordingly, it follows that

P(A /N En) = P(A)P(En) > P(A)* by independence,
|P(A N En) — P(A) < P(A A En) > 0.

Therefore P(A) = P(A)? so that P(A) equals 0 or 1.

For w € , expand w in base 2, m = 0.012 --- , and define Y(w) = w. It is easily seen that

Y(T"~1) = wn, whence the ergodic theorem (Problem (9.7.13)) yields that nl wr ei > 5 as
n —> oo for all w in some event of probability 1.
15. We may as well assume that 0 < a < 1. Let T : [0,1) — [0, 1) be given by T(x) =x +a
(mod 1). It is easily seen that T is invertible and measure-preserving. Furthermore T(X) is uniform
on [0, 1], and it follows that the sequence Z;, Z2,... has the same fdds as Z2, Z3, ..., which is to
say that Z is stationary. It therefore suffices to prove that T is an ergodic shift, since this will imply
by the ergodic theorem that

We use Fourier analysis. Let A be an invariant subset of [0, 1). The indicator function of A has
a Fourier series:
