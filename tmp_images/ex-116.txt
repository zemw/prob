Renewals

In the absence of indications to the contrary, {X, :n > 1} denotes the sequence of interarrival times
of either a renewal process N or a delayed renewal process N’ qd” In either case, F4 and F are the
distribution functions of X; and X> respectively, though F4 # F only if the renewal process is
delayed. We write 44 = E(X2), and shall usually assume that 0 < yz < oo. The functions m and m
denote the renewal functions of N and N4. We write T, = S<#_, X;, the time of the nth arrival.

10.1 Exercises. The renewal equation

1. Prove that E(e2%©) < 00 for some strictly positive 9 whenever E(X,) > 0. [Hint: Consider
the renewal process with interarrival times X k = €1{x,>e} for some suitable €.]

2. Let N be a renewal process and let W be the waiting time until the length of some interarrival
time has exceeded s. That is, W = inf{t : C(t) > s}, where C(t) is the time which has elapsed (at
time 1) since the last arrival. Show that

F w={t ifx <s,
WO 1 = Fs) + [8 Fw —u)dFu) ifx>s,

where F is the distribution function of an interarrival time. If N is a Poisson process with intensity 4,

show that

ford <A,
and E(W) = (e*5 — 1)/A. You may find it useful to rewrite the above integral equation in the form of
a renewal-type equation.

3. Find an expression for the mass function of N(f) in a renewal process whose interarrival times
are: (a) Poisson distributed with parameter 1, (b) gamma distributed, ['(A, b).

4. Let the times between the events of a renewal process N be uniformly distributed on (0, 1). Find
the mean and variance of N(t) forO <1 < 1.

10.2 Exercises. Limit theorems

1. Planes land at Heathrow airport at the times of a renewal process with interarrival time distribution
function F. Each plane contains a random number of people with a given common distribution and
finite mean. Assuming as much independence as usual, find an expression for the rate of arrival of
passengers over a long time period.

2. Let Z1, Z2,... be independent identically distributed random variables with mean 0 and finite
variance o?, and let Ty = "_, Z;. Let M be a finite stopping time with respect to the Z; such that
E(M) < oo. Show that var(Ty) = E(M)o?.
