[1.8.15]-[1.8.22] Exercises Events and their probabilities

15, A random number N of dice is thrown. Let A; be the event that N = i, and assume that
P(A;) = 27',i = 1. The sum of the scores is S. Find the probability that:

(a) N =2 given S = 4;

(b) S =4 given N is even;

(c) N = 2, given that S = 4 and the first die showed 1;

(d) the largest number shown by any die is r, where S is unknown.

16. Let A;, Az,... be a sequence of events. Define

Bn= (J Am, Cn =] Am.

Clearly Cp © An © By. The sequences {B,} and {C,,} are decreasing and increasing respectively
with limits

The events B and C are denoted lim sup,_,4. An and lim infy—oo An respectively. Show that

(a) B = {wm € Q: w € Ay for infinitely many values of 7},

(b) C = {wm € 2: w € Ap for all but finitely many values of 7}.

We say that the sequence { A, } converges to a limit A = lim A, if B and C are the same set A. Suppose
that A, — A and show that

(c) A is an event, in that A € F,

(d) P(An) > P(A).

17. In Problem (1.8.16) above, show that B and C are independent whenever By, and Cy are inde-
pendent for all n. Deduce that if this holds and furthermore A, — A, then P(A) equals either zero or
one.

18. Show that the assumption that P is countably additive is equivalent to the assumption that P is
continuous. That is to say, show that if a function P : ¥ — [0, 1] satisfies P(@) = 0, P(Q) = 1, and
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) whenever A, B € Fand AN B = @, then P is countably additive (in the
sense of satisfying Definition (1.3.1b)) if and only if P is continuous (in the sense of Lemma (1.3.5)).

19. Anne, Betty, Chloé, and Daisy were all friends at school. Subsequently each of the G) =6
subpairs meet up; at each of the six meetings the pair involved quarrel with some fixed probability
p, or become firm friends with probability 1 — p. Quarrels take place independently of each other.
In future, if any of the four hears a rumour, then she tells it to her firm friends only. If Anne hears a
rumour, what is the probability that:

(a) Daisy hears it?

(b) Daisy hears it if Anne and Betty have quarrelled?

(c) Daisy hears it if Betty and Chloé have quarrelled?

(d) Daisy hears it if she has quarrelled with Anne?

20. A biased coin is tossed repeatedly. Each time there is a probability p of a head turning up. Let py
be the probability that an even number of heads has occurred after n tosses (zero is an even number).
Show that pp = 1 and that pp = p(1— pp—-1) + C1 — p) pn_1 ifn = 1. Solve this difference equation.

21. A biased coin is tossed repeatedly. Find the probability that there is a run of r heads in a row
before there is a run of s tails, where r and s are positive integers.

22. A bowl contains twenty cherries, exactly fifteen of which have had their stones removed. A
greedy pig eats five whole cherries, picked at random, without remarking on the presence or absence
of stones. Subsequently, a cherry is picked randomly from the remaining fifteen.
