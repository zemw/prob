7.10 Exercises. Uniform integrability

1. Show that the sum {X, + Y,} of two uniformly integrable sequences {X,} and {Y,} gives a
uniformly integrable sequence.

2. (a) Suppose that X;, > X where r > 1. Show that {|X,|" : > 1} is uniformly integrable, and
deduce that E(X7,) — E(X") if r is an integer.

(b) Conversely, suppose that {|X,|" : » = 1} is uniformly integrable where r > 1, and show that
Xn > XifXp > X.

3. Let g : [0, 00) — [0, co) be an increasing function satisfying g(x)/x — oo as x — oo. Show

that the sequence {X, : n > 1} 1s uniformly integrable if sup, E{g(|Xn|)} < oo.

4. Let {Z, : n > O} be the generation sizes of a branching process with Zo = 1, E(Z,) = 1,

5. Pratt’s lemma. Suppose that Xn < Yn < Zn where X, > X,Y, —> Y,and Z, + Z. If

E(Xn) > E(X) and E(Z,) > E(Z), show that E(Y,) > E(Y).

6. Let {X, :n > 1} be a sequence of variables satisfying E(sup, |Xn|) < oo. Show that {Xp} is
