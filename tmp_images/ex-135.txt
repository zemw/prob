Diffusion processes

13.3 Exercises. Diffusion processes

1. Let X = {X(t) : t = 0} be a simple birth-death process with parameters 1, = nA and fy, = np.
Suggest a diffusion approximation to X.

2. Bartlett’s equation. Let D be a diffusion with instantaneous mean and variance a(t, x) and
b(t, x), and let M(t, 0) = E(e?P©), the moment generating function of D(t). Use the forward
diffusion equation to derive Bartlett’s equation:

3. Write down Bartlett’s equation in the case of the Wiener process D having drift m and instanta-
neous variance 1, and solve it subject to the boundary condition D(O) = 0.

4. Write down Bartlett’s equation in the case of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process D having instan-
taneous mean a(t, x) = —x and variance b(t, x) = 1, and solve it subject to the boundary condition
DO) = 0.

5. Bessel process. If W,(t), W2(t), W3(t) are independent Wiener processes, then R(t) defined as
R? = we + ws + we is the three-dimensional Bessel process. Show that R is a Markov process. Is
this result true in a general number n of dimensions?

6. Show that the transition density for the Bessel process defined in Exercise (5) is
