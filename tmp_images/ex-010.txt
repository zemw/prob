Events and their probabilities

1.2 Exercises. Events as sets

1. Let {A; : i € 7} be a collection of sets. Prove ‘De Morgan’s Laws’t:
c c
(Uai) =() 4%, (ar) = 4.
i i i i

2. Let A and B belong to some o-field F. Show that ¥ contains the sets AN B, A\ B,and AAB.

3. A conventional knock-out tournament (such as that at Wimbledon) begins with 2” competitors
and has n rounds. There are no play-offs for the positions 2, 3, ..., 2” — 1, and the initial table of
draws is specified. Give a concise description of the sample space of all possible outcomes.

4. Let ¥beao-field of subsets of & and suppose that B ¢ ¥. Show that¢ = {AN B:A€e Fhisa
o-field of subsets of B.

5. Which of the following are identically true? For those that are not, say when they are true.

(a) AU(BNC) = (AU B)N (AUC);

(b) AN(BNC)=(ANB)NC;

() (AUB)NC=AU(BNOC);

(@) A\ (BNC) =(A\ B)U(A\C).

1.3 Exercises. Probability

1. Let A and B be events with probabilities P(A) = } and P(B) = 3. Show that 7 < P(ANB) < 3,
and give examples to show that both extremes are possible. Find corresponding bounds for P(A U B).

2. A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Show that, with probability one, a head turns up sooner or later.
Show similarly that any given finite sequence of heads and tails occurs eventually with probability
one. Explain the connection with Murphy’s Law.

3. Six cups and saucers come in pairs: there are two cups and saucers which are red, two white, and
two with stars on. If the cups are placed randomly onto the saucers (one each), find the probability
that no cup is upon a saucer of the same pattern.

+Augustus De Morgan is well known for having given the first clear statement of the principle of mathematical
induction. He applauded probability theory with the words: “The tendency of our study is to substitute the
satisfaction of mental exercise for the pernicious enjoyment of an immoral stimulus”.
