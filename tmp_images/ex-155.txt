are tails}. Then

P(A | BS) = P(A | BS NC)P(C | BS) + P(A | BSN C*)P(CS | B°) =0+ P(A] B)A 9°),

where p = 1 — q is the probability of heads on any single toss. Similarly P(A | B) = p” “14 P(A |

22. (a) Since every cherry has the same chance to be this cherry, notwithstanding the fact that five
are now in the pig, the probability that the cherry in question contains a stone is a = i.

(b) Think about it the other way round. First a random stone is removed, and then the pig chooses
his fruit. This does not change the relevant probabilities. Let C be the event that the removed cherry
contains a stone, and let P be the event that the pig gets at least one stone. Then P(P | C) is the
probability that out of 19 cherries, 15 of which are stoned, the pig gets a stone. Therefore

P(P | C) = 1 — P(pig chooses only stoned cherries |C) = 1 — 3 . ig . 8: iz: i5-

23. Label the seats 1, 2,...,2n clockwise. For the sake of definiteness, we dictate that seat 1 be
occupied by a woman; this determines the sex of the occupant of every other seat. For 1 < k < 2n,
let Ag be the event that seats A, k + 1 are occupied by one of the couples (we identify seat 2n + 1 with
seat 1). The required probability is

Now, P(A;) = n(n — 1)!?/n!, since there are n couples who may occupy seats i andi + 1, (n — 1)!
ways of distributing the remaining n — 1 women, and (n — 1)! ways of distributing the remaining n — 1
men. Similarly, if 1 <i < j <2n, then

where Sj,» is the number of ways of choosing k non-overlapping pairs of adjacent seats.

Finally, we calculate Sx; ,. Consider first the number Nx, of ways of picking k non-overlapping
pairs of adjacent seats from a line (rather than a circle) of m seats labelled 1, 2, ..., m. There is a one—
one correspondence between the set of such arrangements and the set of (m — k)—vectors containing
