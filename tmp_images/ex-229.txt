32. (i) Fix Cartesian axes within the gut in question. Taking one end of the needle as the origin,
the other end is uniformly distributed on the unit sphere of R°. With the X-ray plate parallel to the
(x, y)-plane, the projected length V of the needle satisfies V > v if and only if |Z| < /1—- v2, where
Z is the (random) z-coordinate of the ‘loose’ end of the needle. Hence, for 0 < uv < 1,

4/1] — 12
PV >v) =P(-VI1-w <Z< Vi-v) = VE ‘ “= V1 -2?,

since 4x 1/1 — v2 is the surface area of that part of the unit sphere satisfying |z| < \/1— v2 (use
Archimedes’s theorem of the circumscribing cylinder, or calculus). Therefore V has density function
fy(v) =0/V1—-v? forO <u <1.

Gi) Draw a picture, if you can. The lengths of the projections are determined by the angle © between
the plane of the cross and the X-ray plate, together with the angle W of rotation of the cross about an
axis normal to its arms. Assume that © and W are independent and uniform on [0, $m]. If the axis
system has been chosen with enough care, we find that the lengths A, B of the projections of the arms
are given by

A= \cos2 W + sin? & cos2 ©, B= \/ sin? W + cos? W cos ©,

Some slog is now required to calculate the Jacobian J of this mapping, and the answer will be
fa,p(a, b) = 4|J|2—2 for 0 < a,b < 1,a* +b? > 1.

34. Recall Problem (4.14.4). First, Z; = F(X;), 1 <i <n, is a sequence of independent variables
with the uniform distribution on [0, 1]. Secondly, a variable U has the latter distribution if and only
if — log U has the exponential distribution with parameter 1.
