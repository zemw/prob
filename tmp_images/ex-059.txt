[5.2.6]-[5.3.6] Exercises Generating functions and their applications

6. An unfair coin is flipped repeatedly, where P(H) = p = 1 — q. Let X be the number of flips
until HTH first appears, and Y the number of flips until either HTH or THT appears. Show that
E(s*) = (p2qs3)/(1 — s + pqs” — pqs?) and find E(s’).

7. Matching again. The pile of (by now dog-eared) letters is dropped again and enveloped at
random, yielding X, matches. Show that P(Xn = j) = Gi + DP(Xn41 = j + 1). Deduce that the
derivatives of the Gr;(s) = E(s*") satisfy Gi, 41= Gn, and hence derive the conclusion of Example

(3.4.3), namely:
rte == 2 (dd yg GV)
neO= sor 3I @—ni)

8. Let X have a Poisson distribution with parameter A, where A is exponential with parameter pw.
Show that X has a geometric distribution.

9. Coupons. Recall from Exercise (3.3.2) that each packet of an overpriced commodity contains a
worthless plastic object. There are four types of object, and each packet is equally likely to contain
any of the four. Let T be the number of packets you open until you first have the complete set. Find
E(s?) and P(T =k).

5.3 Exercises. Random walk
1. For a simple random walk S$ with Sg = 0 and p = 1-—gq < i, show that the maximum
M = max{Sy : n > 0} satisfies P(M > r) = (p/q)’ forr > 0.

2. Use generating functions to show that, for a symmetric random walk,
(a) 2kfo(2k) = P(S2%~-2 = 0) for k > 1, and
(b) P(S,S2--- Son 4 0) = P(S2, = 0) forn > 1.

3. Avparticle performs arandom walk on the corners of the square ABCD. At each step, the probability
of moving from corner c to corner d equals p-g, where

PAB = PBA = PCD = PDC = &, PAD = PDA = PBC = PcB = B,

anda, B > 0,a+ 6 = 1. Let Ga(s) be the generating function of the sequence (paa(n) : n > 0),
where paa(7) is the probability that the particle is at A after n steps, having started at A. Show that

1f 4 1
Gx =3 {3+ too}

Hence find the probability generating function of the time of the first return to A.

4. A particle performs a symmetric random walk in two dimensions starting at the origin: each
step is of unit length and has equal probability i of being northwards, southwards, eastwards, or
westwards. The particle first reaches the line x + y = m at the point (X, Y) and at the time T. Find
the probability generating functions of T and X — Y, and state where they converge.

5. Derive the arc sine law for sojourn times, Theorem (3.10.21), using generating functions. That
is to say, let Lz, be the length of time spent (up to time 27) by a simple symmetric random walk to
the right of its starting point. Show that

P(Lon = 2k) = P(Sox = O)P(Son—2g = 0) = forO SK <n.

6. Let {S, : 2 > 0} be a simple symmetric random walk with Sg = 0, and let T = min{n > 0:
Sn = O}. Show that

E(min{T, 2m}) = 2E|S2m| = 4mP(Som =0) for m > 0.
