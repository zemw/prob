Problems Solutions [13.12.19]-[13.12.20]

where A; _1 (k) is the number of permutations with x; in the final place, for which exactly r — 1 of the
first n ~ 1 terms are strictly positive. Consider a permutation 7 = (Xj, , Xin, ---,Xig_1> Xk) With xy in
the final place, and move the position of x; to obtain the new permutation x’ = (xz, Kips Xins ++ +s Xin)

The first appearance of the maximum in 7’ is at its rth place if and only if the first maximum of the
reduced permutation (xj, , xj,,---,Xi,_1) is at its (r — 1)th place. [Note that r = 0 is impossible
since s, > 0.] It follows that

where B,_1(k) is the number of permutations with x, in the final place, for which the first appearance
of the maximum is at the (r — 1)th place.

By the induction hypothesis, A,_;(k) = B,— (k), since these quantities depend on the n — 1
terms excluding x,;. The result follows.
19. Suppose that Sm = viel X;, 0 < m < ni, are the partial sums of n independent identically
distributed random variables X;. Let An be the number of strictly positive partial sums, and Ry, the
index of the first appearance of the value of the maximal partial sum. Each of the n! permutations
of (X,, X2,..., Xn) has the same joint distribution. Consider the kth permutation, and let J; be
the indicator function of the event that exactly 7 partial sums are positive, and let Jz be the indicator
function that the first appearance of the maximum is at the rth place. Then, using Problem (13.12.18),

P(An =r) = mi 2 Pele) = ni 2 Pe) =P(Rn =r).

We apply this with X; = W(jt/n) — W(j — 1t/n), so that Sy, = W(mt/n). Thus A, =
ay Tw (jt/n)>0} has the same distribution as

Rn = min{k > 0: W(kt/n) = max W(jt/n)}.

By Problem (13.12.17), Rn #4; Rasn — oo. By Problem (13.12.16), the time spent by W at zero

is a.s. anull set, whence A, 25; A. Hence A and R have the same distribution. We argue as follows
to obtain that that L and R have the same distribution. Making repeated use of Theorem (13.4.6) and
the symmetry of W,

Finally, by Problem (13.12.15) and the circular symmetry of the joint density distribution of two
independent N(0, 1) variables U, V,

P(IWa) — WO) < |W@)|) = P(x) V2 <xU*) =P (aon
