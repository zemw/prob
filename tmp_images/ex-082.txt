Birth-death processes and imbedding Exercises [6.9.9]-[6.11.4]

9. Let i be a transient state of a continuous-time Markov chain X with X(0) = i. Show that the
total time spent in state i has an exponential distribution.

10. Let X be an asymmetric simple random walk in continuous time on the non-negative integers
with retention at 0, so that

Ah+oth) iff =it+1,i2>0,
pij(h) = tps .
ph+oth) iff=i-1,i>1.
Suppose that X(0) = 0 and A > yw. Show that the total time V; spent in state r is exponentially
distributed with parameter A — je.
Assume now that X(0) has some general distribution with probability generating function G.
Find the expected amount of time spent at 0 in terms of G.

11. Let X = {X(t) : t > 0} beanon-explosive irreducible Markov chain with generator G and unique
stationary distribution 7. The mean recurrence time jzx is defined as follows. Suppose X(0) = k,
and let U = inf{s : X(s) #k}. Then py = E(inf{t > U : X(t) = k}). Let Z = {Zp : n > 0} be the
imbedded ‘jump chain’ given by Zp = X(0) and Z,, is the value of X just after its nth jump.

(a) Show that Z has stationary distribution # satisfying

where g; = —g;;, provided >>, 2;g; < oo. When is it the case that # = 1?

(b) Show that 2; = 1/(;9;) if uz < oo, and that the mean recurrence time ji; of the state k in the
jump chain Z satisfies iz; = ux >>; 7:8; if the last sum is finite.

12. Let Z be an irreducible discrete-time Markov chain on a countably infinite state space S, having
transition matrix H = (h;;) satisfying hj; = 0 for all states i, and with stationary distribution v.
Construct a continuous-time process X on S for which Z is the imbedded chain, such that X has no
stationary distribution.

1. Describe the jump chain for a birth-death process with rates Ay, and fn.

2. Consider an immigration-death process X, being a birth-death process with birth rates A, = 2
and death rates x, = ny. Find the transition matrix of the jump chain Z, and show that it has as

stationary distribution

Tn rn!) ( + ") pe

where p = A/. Explain why this differs from the stationary distribution of X.

3. Consider the birth—death process X with A, = nA and py, = ny foralln > 0. Suppose X (0) = 1
and let n(¢) = P(X (t) = 0). Show that 7 satisfies the differential equation

WO+Q+u)n@ =Ht+an@’.

Hence find 7(t), and calculate P(X (¢) = 0 | X(u) = 0) forO <t <u.

4. For the birth-death process of the previous exercise with X < yu, show that the distribution of
X(t), conditional on the event {X(¢) > O}, converges as t — co to a geometric distribution.
