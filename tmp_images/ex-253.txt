[5.7.10]-[5.8.2] Solutions Generating functions and their applications

10. By definition,

9 gx(y) = / BOD F(x) dz.

Now multiply by fy (y), integrate over y € R, and change the order of integration with an appeal to
Fubini’s theorem.

11. (a) We adopt the usual convention that integrals of the form ihe g(y) dF (y) include any atom of
the distribution function F at the upper endpoint v but not at the lower endpoint u. It is a consequence
that F, is right-continuous, and it is immediate that F; increases from 0 to 1. Therefore F; is a
distribution function. The corresponding moment generating function is

(b) The required moment generating function is

the product of the moment generating functions of the individual tilted distributions.

5.8 Solutions. Examples of characteristic functions

1. (i) We have that A(t) = E(e#X) = E(e“#%) = g_x(t).

(ii) If X; and X> are independent random variables with common characteristic function @, then
0%, 4+X7 (1) = $x, OGx, (1) = 60".

(iii) Similarly, @x,-x, ©) = dx, OO-x,() = 68D = 16 OP.

(iv) Let X have characteristic function @, and let Z be equal to X with probability 5 and to —X
otherwise. The characteristic function of Z is given by

oz(t) = 4(E(e™*) + E(e#*)) = 3 (6) + OO) = Re),

where we have used the argument of part (i) above.
(v) If X is Bernoulli with parameter 7 then its characteristic function is @(¢) = 5 + zel . Suppose Y

is a random variable with characteristic function w(t) = |@(t)|. Then w(t)? = (t)¢(—t). Written
in terms of random variables this asserts that Y; + Y> has the same distribution as X; — X 2, where
the Y; are independent with characteristic function y, and the X; are independent with characteristic
function ¢. Now X; € {0, 1}, so that X; — X2 € {—1, 0, 1}, and therefore Y; € {-4, 4}. Write
a = P(Y; = 4). Then

P(Y| + ¥o = 1) =a? = P(X] — X= 1) = G,
PY, + Yo =—1) =(1-a)? = P(X — X2 =-1) = Gj,
implying that «2 = (1 — a)? so that a = 7 contradicting the fact that ¢? = 5. We deduce that no
such variable Y exists.

2. Fort > 0,
P(X > x) = P(e!® > e!*) < ce Ee!*),

Now minimize over t > 0.
