[5.12.20]-[5.12.30] Exercises Generating functions and their applications

20. Let X have density function f and characteristic function ¢, and suppose that feo |P(t)| dt < ow.
Deduce that

F(x) = = [ aco dt.

21. Conditioned branching process. Consider a branching process whose family sizes have the
geometric mass function f(k) = qp* ,k > 0, where uw = p/q > 1. Let Z, be the size of the nth
generation, and assume Zp = 1. Show that the conditional distribution of Z,/j”, given that Z, > 0,
converges as n —> oo to the exponential distribution with parameter 1 — po!

22. A random variable X is called symmetric if X and —X are identically distributed. Show that X
is symmetric if and only if the imaginary part of its characteristic function is identically zero.

23. Let X and Y be independent identically distributed variables with means 0 and variances 1. Let

(t) be their common characteristic function, and suppose that X + Y and X — Y are independent.
Show that @(2t) = (t)?(—1), and deduce that X and Y are N(0, 1) variables.

More generally, suppose that X and Y are independent and identically distributed with means 0
and variances 1, and furthermore that E(X — Y | X + Y) = Oand var(X — Y | X + Y) = 2. Deduce
that @(s)? = $’(s)? — 6(s)¢”(s), and hence that X and Y are independent N(0, 1) variables.

24. Show that the average Z = n—! >, X; of n independent Cauchy variables has the Cauchy
distribution too. Why does this not violate the law of large numbers?

25. Let X and Y be independent random variables each having the Cauchy density function f(x) =
{r(1 +. x?)}—1, and let Z = $(X +).

(a) Show by using characteristic functions that Z has the Cauchy distribution also.

(b) Show by the convolution formula that Z has the Cauchy density function. You may find it helpful

to check first that

where g(y) = 2/{xy(4 + y*)}.
26. Let X1, X2,..., X» be independent variables with characteristic functions $1, $2, ...,¢n,. De-

27. Find the characteristic functions corresponding to the following density functions on (—0oo, 00):
(a) 1/cosh(zx), (b) (1 — cosx)/(x?),
(c) exp(—x — e*), (d) de,
Show that the mean of the ‘extreme-value distribution’ in part (c) is Euler’s constant y.

28. Which of the following are characteristic functions:
(a) o(t) = 1 — |t| if |t| < 1, 6(t) = 0 otherwise,
)o@)=A+t4) 1, ©e@ =exp-r*,
(d) o(t) = cost, (e) (t) = 2(1 — cost) /t”.
29. Show that the characteristic function @ of a random variable X satisfies |1 — @(t)| < E|rX|.

30. Suppose X and Y have joint characteristic function @(s, t). Show that, subject to the appropriate
conditions of differentiability,
