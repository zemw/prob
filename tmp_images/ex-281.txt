Markov chains

6.1 Solutions. Markov processes
1. The sequence X 1, X,... of independent random variables satisfies
PUXng1 = J | X1 =i1,...,Xa = in) = PXng1 = S),

whence the sequence is a Markov chain. The chain is homogeneous if the X; are identically distributed.

2. (a) With Y,, the outcome of the nth throw, X,41 = max{Xn, Y;,+41}, so that

0 ifj<i
py =4 gi iff=i
i iff >i,

for 1 <i, j <6. Similarly,

(n) 0 ifj <i
s(n) =
Pij (gi)” if fai.

If 7 > i, then pjj (1) = P(Z, = j), where Zp = max{Yj, Y2,..., Yn}, and an elementary calculation

yields
‘\n - n
py() = (2) -() , i<j <6

(b) Nn+1 — Nn is independent of N,, N2,..., Nn, so that N is Markovian with

if j=i+1,

Pi = if j =i,

otherwise.

(c) The evolution of C is given by

0 if the die shows 6,
Cr+ = :
C,+1~ otherwise,
whence C is Markovian with
Pij = j=it+l,
otherwise.
