5. Let X bea birth—death process with A, = nd and zn = ny, and suppose X (0) = 1. Show that
the time T at which X(t) first takes the value 0 satisfies

What happens when A = 2?

6. Let X be the birth-death process of Exercise (5) with 4 4 wy, and let V;(t) be the total amount
of time the process has spent in state r > 0, up to time ¢. Find the distribution of Vj (oo) and the
generating function >°, s’E(V;(t)). Hence show in two ways that E(Vj(oo)) = [max{a, phy.
Show further that E(V,(00)) = 4°~!r7|[max{a, p}IT".

7. Repeat the calculations of Exercise (6) in the case A = pw.

6.12 Exercises. Special processes

1. Customers entering a shop are served in the order of their arrival by the single server. They
arrive in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity 4, and their service times are independent
exponentially distributed random variables with parameter 4. By considering the jump chain, show
that the expected duration of a busy period B of the server is (u — 4)! when A < yw. (The busy
period runs from the moment a customer arrives to find the server free until the earliest subsequent
time when the server is again free.)

2. Disasters. Immigrants arrive at the instants of a Poisson process of rate v, and each independently
founds a simple birth process of rate A. At the instants of an independent Poisson process of rate 6,
the population is annihilated. Find the probability generating function of the population X (ft), given
that X(0) = 0.

3. More disasters. In the framework of Exercise (2), suppose that each immigrant gives rise to a
simple birth—-death process of rates ) and yz. Show that the mean population size stays bounded if and
only if >A — pw.

4. The queue M/G/oo. (See Section 11.1.) An ftp server receives clients at the times of a Poisson
process with parameter A, beginning at time 0. The ith client remains connected for a length S;
of time, where the S; are independent identically distributed random variables, independent of the
process of arrivals. Assuming that the server has an infinite capacity, show that the number of clients
being serviced at time ¢ has the Poisson distribution with parameter A fo {1 — G(x)] dx, where G is
the common distribution function of the $;.

6.13 Exercises. Spatial Poisson processes

1. In a certain town at time tf = 0 there are no bears. Brown bears and grizzly bears arrive as
independent Poisson processes B and G with respective intensities B and y.
(a) Show that the first bear is brown with probability B/(6 + y).

(b) Find the probability that between two consecutive brown bears, there arrive exactly r grizzly
bears.

(c) Given that B(1) = 1, find the expected value of the time at which the first bear arrived.

2. Campbell—Hardy theorem. Let IT be the points of a non-homogeneous Poisson process on Rd
with intensity function 4. Let S = S°,e7 g(x) where g is a smooth function which we assume for
