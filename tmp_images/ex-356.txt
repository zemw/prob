excursion fromi. By the strong Markov property, the T (7) are independent and identically distributed
with mean j;. Furthermore,

By the strong law of large numbers and the fact that V; (7) =: 00 as n —> 00, the two outer terms
sandwich the central term, and the result follows.

33. (a) Since the chain is persistent, we may assume without loss of generality that Xp = j. Define
the times R,, R2,... of return to j, the sojourn lengths $;, S2,... in j, and the times Vj, V2,...
between visits to 7. By the Markov property and the strong law of large numbers,

Also, Rn/Rn+1 —> 1, since 4; = E(R1) < 00. If Rn <t < Ry41, then

Let n —> oo to obtain the result.

(b) Note by Theorem (6.9.21) that pj;;(¢) > 1; ast — 00. We take expectations of the integral in
part (a), and the claim follows as in Corollary (6.4.22).

(c) Use the fact that

together with the method of solution of Problem (7.11.32b).

34, (a) By the first Borel—Cantelli lemma, X, = Y, for all but finitely many values of n, almost
surely. Off an event of probability zero, the sequences are identical for all large n.

(b) This follows immediately from part (a), since X, — Y, = 0 for all large n, almost surely.
(c) By the above, a7! $7, (X, — Yr) = 0, which implies the claim.
