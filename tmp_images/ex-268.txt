Problems Solutions [5.12.15]-[5.12.16]

(b) Suppose that ¢ is the characteristic function of an infinitely divisible distribution, and let wy, be a
characteristic function such that #(t) = wn(t)". Now |@(f)| < 1 for all £, so that

1 if || 49,
_ l/n
oH|\= t ->
lYa(t)| = 1 { 0 if|o)| <0.
For any value of ¢ such that ¢(t) # 0, it is the case that W(t) > lasn > OO, To see this, suppose
instead that there exists 6 satisfying 0 < 9 < 2m such that y(t) > e° along some subsequence.
Then y(t)” does not converge along this subsequence, a contradiction. It follows that

. 1 if d(t) 49,
* t)= lim t=
(#) vO) = lim vn {6 fp) <0.

Now ¢ is a characteristic function, so that ¢(+) 4 0 on some neighbourhood of the origin. Hence
w(t) = 1 on some neighbourhood of the origin, so that y is continuous at the origin. Applying the
continuity theorem (5.9.5), we deduce that w is itself a characteristic function. In particular, y is
continuous, and hence y(t) = 1 for all t, by (x). We deduce that ¢(+) # 0 for all r.

15. We have that

_ ay PS=n|N=n)P(N=n) —_ p*P(N =n)
PIN =n | S=N)= YEP(SH=kKIN=HPN=KH YO, PEPIN =k)"

Hence E(x” | S = N) = G(px)/G(p).
If N is Poisson with parameter A, then

eM(px—l)

apaty = OP = GY.

EG’ |S=N)=
Conversely, suppose that E(x® | § = N) = G(x)?. Then G(px) = G(p)G(x)?, valid for |x} < 1,
0 < p <1. Therefore f(x) = log G(X) satisfies f (px) = f(p) + pf (x), and in addition f has a
power series expansion which is convergent at least for0 < x < 1. Substituting this expansion into the

above functional equation for f , and equating coefficients of p'x/, we obtain that f(x) = —A(1 — x)
for some A > 0. It follows that N has a Poisson distribution.

giving that X, Y, and X + Y have distributions similar to the negative binomial distribution. More
specifically,
