Problems Solutions [1.8.17]-[1.8.20]

(c) It suffices to note that B is a countable intersection of countable unions of events, and is therefore
an event.
(d) We have that

CO oO

Ch = () 4i S An S LU 4: = Bn,

tn i=n
and therefore P(Cy,) < P(An) < P(B,). By the continuity of probability measures (1.3.5), if Ch > C
then P(C,) > P(C), and if B, — B then P(B,) > P(B). If B = C = A then

P(A) = P(C) < lim P(An) < P(C) = P(A).

17. If By, and Cy are independent for all n then, using the fact that Cy, C By,
P(Bp)P(Cn) = P(Ban ON Cn) = P(Ch) > PCC) asn—> oo,

and also P(B,)P(Cn) — P(B)P(C) as n > o0, so that P(C) = P(B)P(C), whence either P(C) = 0
or P(B) = 1 or both. In any case P(B NC) = P(B)P(C).
If An > Athen A = B =C so that P(A) equals 0 or 1.

18. Itis standard (Lemma (1.3.5)) that P is continuous if it is countably additive. Suppose then that P is
finitely additive and continuous. Let Ay, Az, ... be disjoint events. Then UP? Aj = limn—+oo Uf Ai,
so that, by continuity and finite-additivity,

19. The network of friendship is best represented as a square with diagonals, with the corners labelled
A, B, C, and D. Draw a diagram. Each link of the network is absent with probability p. We write EF
for the event that a typical link EF is present, and EF® for its complement. We write A < D for the
event that A is connected to D by present links.
(d) P(A D| AD‘) = P(A & D| ADS NBC)p + P(A & D | AD® NBC)(1 — p)

= {1-(1— (=p)? }p + (1— py — p).
(c) P(A + D| BC) =P(A & Dj] ADS NBC)p + P(A @ D| BC’ NAD)(1 — p)

= {1-(—(—py)?}p+(1- p).
(b) P(A <= D] ABS) = P(A @ D] ABS NAD*)p + P(A & Dj ABS NAD) — p)

=(1—- p){1- pd-(—p))}p + — p).
(a) P(A oD) =P(A@D| AD )p+P(A <D]| AD)(1 — p)

20. We condition on the result of the first toss. If this is a head, then we require an odd number of
heads in the next n — 1 tosses. Similarly, if the first toss is a tail, we require an even number of heads
in the next n — 1 tosses. Hence

Pa = Pl — pa-1) + - p)pa-1 = (1 — 2p) pn_1 t+ Pp

with po = 1. As an alternative to induction, we may seek a solution of the form py = A+ BA”.
Substitute this into the above equation to obtain

A+ BA" =(1—2p)A+ (1 —2p) Ba"! 4 p
