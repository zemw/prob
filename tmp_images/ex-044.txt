4.9 Exercises. Multivariate normal distribution

1. A symmetric matrix is called non-negative (respectively positive) definite if its eigenvalues are
non-negative (respectively strictly positive). Show that a non-negative definite symmetric matrix V
has a square root, in that there exists a symmetric matrix W satisfying W* = V. Show further that W
is non-singular if and only if V is positive definite.

2. If X is a random vector with the N(, V) distribution where V is non-singular, show that Y =
(X - pw! has the N(0, I) distribution, where I is the identity matrix and W is a symmetric matrix
satisfying W2 = V. Therandom vector Y is said to have the standard multivariate normal distribution.

3. Let X = (X1, X2,..., Xn) have the N(, V) distribution, and show that Y = a, X, + a.Xo +
.++ ++ ayXy has the (univariate) N(w, o2) distribution where

n i
w= > ajE(X;), = Da? var(X;) +2) > ajajcov(X;, Xj).

4, Let X and Y have the bivariate normal distribution with zero means, unit variances, and correlation
p. Find the joint density function of X + Y and X — Y, and their marginal density functions.

5. Let X have the N(0, 1) distribution and let a > 0. Show that the random variable Y given by
, ye { X if |X| <a
~ (=x if |X|>a
has the N(0, 1) distribution, and find an expression for p(a) = cov(X, Y) in terms of the density
function ¢ of X. Does the pair (X, Y) have a bivariate normal distribution?

6. Let {¥, : 1 <r <n} be independent N(O, 1) random variables, and define X; = aan cir Yr,
1 <r <1, for constants cjy. Show that

E(X; | Xx) = (ae) Xp.

What is var(X; | X;)?

7. Let the vector (X; : 1 <r <n) have a multivariate normal distribution with covariance matrix
V = (v;;). Show that, conditional on the event Hi Xy = x, X1 has the N(a, b) distribution where

a = (ps/t)x, b =s*(1 — p*), ands? = v1, 1? = Oj; uj, 0 = Dy MA /(t).

8. Let X, Y, and Z have a standard trivariate normal distribution centred at the origin, with zero
means, unit variances, and correlation coefficients p1, 92, and p3. Show that

9. Let X, Y, Z have the standard trivariate normal density of Exercise (8), with pj = o(X, Y). Show
that

E(Z | X,Y) = {(03 — pip2)X + (o2 — p103)¥ }/(1 — pj),
var(Z | X, ¥) = {1 — pf — 63 — 93 + 210203}/(1 — pj).
