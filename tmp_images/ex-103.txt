[7.11.20]-[7.11.26] Exercises Convergence of random variables

20. Let X1, X2,... be random variables satisfying var(X;) < c for all n and some constant c. Show
that the sequence obeys the weak law, in the sense that n=! 21 (X; — EX;) converges in probability
to 0, if the correlation coefficients satisfy either of the following:

(i) p(X;, Xj) < 0 for alli F j,
(ii) o(X;, Xj) > Oas fi — j| > o.

21. Let X;, X2,... be independent random variables with common density function

0 if |x| < 2,
FI=) f  tiei > 2,
x” log |x|

: P
where c is a constant. Show that the X; have no mean, but n} an X; — Oasn — oo. Show that
convergence does not take place almost surely.

22. Let X, be the Euclidean distance between two points chosen independently and uniformly from
the n-dimensional unit cube. Show that E(X;,)/./n > 1 [V6 asn — oo.

23. Let X 1, X2,... be independent random variables having the uniform distribution on [—1, 1].

24. Let X,, X2,... be independent random variables, each X; having mass function given by

P(X, =) = POX = -D = 5 l-a ifk > 1.

Show that U, = >7] X; satisfies U,/./n » N(O, 1) but var(U,/./n) > 2 asn > 0.
25. Let X1, X2,... be random variables, and let Ny, Nz,... be random variables taking values in
the positive integers such that Nz an oo as k — oo. Show that:
(i) if Xp, 2 X and the X, are independent of the Nz, then XN, ms Xakoow,
(ii) if Xn 2 X then Xy, > X ask > ov.
26. Stirling’s formula.

(a) Leta(k,n) = nk /(k — 1)! for 1 <k <n-+1. Use the fact that 1—x < e~* ifx > 0 to show that

ah) <P) tk > 0.
a(n+1,n) — ~

(b) Let X,, X2,... be independent Poisson variables with parameter 1, and let S, = X; +---+ Xp.
Define the function g : R > R by

(x) {o. ifO0>x>-M,

where M is large and positive. Show that, for large n,
