(b) The characteristic function @p of Fp is given by

where ¢ is the characteristic function of F. Now @(pt) = 1+ipupt +o0(p) as p J 0, so that

L+tippt+o(p) 1+4+0(1)
dp(t) = Toi = -

as p | 0. The limit is the characteristic function of the exponential distribution with mean jz, and the
continuity theorem tells us that the process M converges in distribution as p | 0 to a Poisson process
with intensity 1/j (in the sense that the interarrival time distribution converges to the appropriate
limit).
(c) If M and N have the same fdds, then ¢p(t) = (t), which implies that #(pt) = o(t)/(p + g@()).
Hence y(t) = g(t)! satisfies w(pt) = q+ pw(t) fort € R. Now yw is continuous, and it follows as
in the solution to Problem (5.12.15) that y has the form y(t) = 1+ Bt, implying that d(t) = (1 +Bt)7!
for some 8 € C. The only characteristic function of this form is that of an exponential distribution,
and the claim follows.

17. (a) Let N(t) be the number of times the sequence has been typed up to the th keystroke. Then N is
arenewal process whose interarrival times have the required mean 4; we have that E(N(t))/t > po
as t — oo. Now each epoch of time marks the completion of such a sequence with probability

(ao) so that

1 1 t 1 14 1 14

implying that 4 = 1028.

The problem with ‘omo’ is ‘omomo’ (i.e., appearances may overlap). Let us call an epoch
of time a ‘renewal point’ if it marks the completion of the word ‘omo’, disjoint from the words
completed at previous renewal points. In each appearance of ‘omo’, either the first ‘o’ or the second
‘o’ (but not both) is a renewal point. Therefore the probability u,, that n is a renewal point, satisfies
(0) =Unt+ un—2 (79g): Average this over n to obtain

and therefore jz = 10° + 102.
(b) (i) Arguing as for ‘omo’, we obtain p? =Unt+ pun_1 + p-Un—2; whence p? =(l+p+ p*)/w.
Gi) Similarly, p?q = un + pqun—p, so that w = (1 + pq)/(p?4).
18. The fdds of {N(u) — N(t) : u > t} depend on the distributions of E(t) and of the interarrival
times. In a stationary renewal process, the distribution of E(t) does not depend on the value of t,
whence {N(u) — N(t) : u > t} has the same fdds as {N(u) : u > O}, implying that X is strongly
stationary.
19, We use the renewal-reward theorem. The mean time between expeditions is Bu, and this is
the mean length of a cycle of the process. The mean cost of keeping the bears during a cycle is
5 B(B — 1ecp, whence the long-run average cost is {d + B(B — 1)cu/2}/(By).
