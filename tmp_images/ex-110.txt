9.1 Exercises. Introduction

1. Let...,Z_1, Zo, Z1, Zo, ... be independent real random variables with means 0 and variances
1, and let a, 8 € R. Show that there exists a (weakly) stationary sequence {W,} satisfying W, =
aW,—-1 + BWn-2 + Zn, n = ...,—1,0,1,..., if the (possibly complex) zeros of the quadratic
equation z2 — wz — 6 = O are smaller than 1 in absolute value.

2. Let U be uniformly distributed on [0, 1] with binary expansion U = aa Xx 7277. Show that
the sequence

CO
Vn = >_Xign2!, n=O,

i=l
is strongly stationary, and calculate its autocovariance function.

3. Let {X,:n=...,—1,0,1,...} bea stationary real sequence with mean 0 and autocovariance
function c(m).
(i) Show that the infinite series 0 anX pn converges almost surely, and in mean square, whenever
