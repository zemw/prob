7. Appoint D is fixed on the side BC of the triangle ABC. Two points P and Q are picked independently
at random in ABD and ADC respectively. Show that EJAPQ| = |AG,Go| = lABCl, where G, and
Gp are the centres of gravity of ABD and ADC.

8. From the set of all triangles that are similar to the triangle ABC, similarly oriented, and inside
ABC, one is selected uniformly at random. Show that its mean area is tb |ABC].

9. Two points X and Y are picked independently at random in the interval (0, a). By varying a,
show that F(z, a) = P(|X — Y| < z) satisfies

and hence find F(z, a). Let r > 1, and show that m,(a) = E(|X — Y{") satisfies

10. Lines are laid down independently at random on the plane, dividing it into polygons. Show that
the average number of sides of this set of polygons is 4. [Hint: Consider n random great circles of a
sphere of radius R; then let R and n increase.)

11. A point P is picked at random in the triangle ABC. The lines AP, BP, CP, produced, meet BC,
AC, AB respectively at L, M, N. Show that E|LMN| = (10 — m*)|ABC].

12. Sylvester’s problem. If four points are picked independently at random inside the triangle ABC,

show that the probability that no one of them lies inside the triangle formed by the other three is z.

Hence find m;(a).

13. Ifthree points P, Q, R are picked independently at random ina disk of radius a, show that E|PQR| =
35a”/(487). [You may find it useful that fj’ [> sin? x sin? y sin |x — y|dx dy = 357 /128.]

14. Two points A and B are picked independently at random inside a disk C’.. Show that the probability
that the circle having centre A and radius |AB| lies inside C is é.

15. Two points A and B are picked independently at random inside a ball S. Show that the probability
that the sphere having centre A and radius |AB| lies inside S is y-
