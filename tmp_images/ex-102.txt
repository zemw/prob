for some non-negative constants a and p.
You have shown that H is the distribution function of Y—!, where Y has a Weibull distribution.
14. Let X1, X2,..., Xp be independent and identically distributed random variables with the Cauchy

distribution. Show that M, = max{X,, X2,..., Xn} is such that 7 M,/n converges in distribution,
the limiting distribution function being given by H(x) = e7!/* if x > 0.
15. Let X,, Xo,... be independent and identically distributed random variables whose common
characteristic function ¢ satisfies @’(0) = ij. Show that n7! dj=1 Xj 4 [L.
16. Total variation distance. The total variation distance dpy(X, Y) between two random variables
X and Y is defined by

apy(X,Y)= — sup EGC) — E(u(Y))|

u:|Ulloo=
where the supremum is over all (measurable) functions u : R — R such that |ju|loo = sup, |u(x)|
satisfies |[u|loo = 1.
(a) If X and ¥ are discrete with respective masses f, and gy at the points x, show that

dpy(X,Y) = 3° | fn — gn| = 2 sup |P(X € A) — PY € A)j.

(b) If X and Y are continuous with respective density functions f and g, show that

OO

dpy(X,Y) = / Lf (x) — g(x)|dx = 2 sup [P(X € A) -— PY € A).

(c) Show that dpy(Xn, X) — 0 implies that X, — X in distribution, but that the converse is false.

(d) Maximal coupling. Show that P(X 4 Y) > 5dty(X , Y), and that there exists a pair X’, Y’
having the same marginals for which equality holds.
(e) If X;, Y; are independent random variables, show that

19. (a) Suppose that X;, X2, ... isa sequence of random variables, each having a normal distribution,

and such that X, ®. x. Show that X has a normal distribution, possibly degenerate.
(b) For each n > 1, let (Xn, Yn) be a pair of random variables having a bivariate normal distribution.
