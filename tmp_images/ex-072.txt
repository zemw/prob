47. Inn flips of a biased coin which shows heads with probability p (= 1 — q), let Ly be the length
of the longest run of heads. Show that, for r > 1,

48. The random process {X, : n > 1} decays geometrically fast in that, in the absence of external
input, Xp41 = 5X n- However, at any time n the process is also increased by Y, with probability
4, where {Y;, : n > 1} is a sequence of independent exponential random variables with parameter 1.
Find the limiting distribution of X;, as n > oo.

49. Let G(s) = E(s*) where X > 0. Show that E{(X + 1)7}} = fo G(s) ds, and evaluate this
when X is (a) Poisson with parameter A, (b) geometric with parameter p, (c) binomial bin(n, p), (d)
logarithmic with parameter p (see Exercise (5.2.3)). Is there a non-trivial choice for the distribution
of X such that E{(X + 1)7!} = (R(X +. yy}?

50. Find the density function of yy Xy, where {X, : r > 1} are independent and exponentially
distributed with parameter 1, and N is geometric with parameter p and independent of the X;.

51. Let X have finite non-zero variance and characteristic function ¢(t). Show that

is a characteristic function, and find the corresponding distribution.

52. Let X and Y have joint density function

fay =H{ttrxy@?-y%)}, el <1, ly <1.

Show that ¢y (t)@y (t) = @x+y (t), and that X and Y are dependent.
