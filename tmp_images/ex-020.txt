2.3 Exercises. Discrete and continuous variables

1. Let X be a random variable with distribution function F, and let a = (am : —-oO < m < cw)
be a strictly increasing sequence of real numbers satisfying a_m™ — —oo and am — co asm —> ov.
Define G(x) = P(X < am) when a,,-| <x < am, So that G is the distribution function of a discrete
random variable. How does the function G behave as the sequence a is chosen in such a way that
SUP,, |dm — Am—1| becomes smaller and smaller?

2. Let X be a random variable and let g : R > R be continuous and strictly increasing. Show that
Y = g(X) is arandom variable.

3. Let X be arandom variable with distribution function

0 ifx <0,
P(X <x}=4 x if0<x <1,
1 ifx>t.

Let F be a distribution function which is continuous and strictly increasing. Show that Y = F -1(X)
is arandom variable having distribution function F’. Is itnecessary that F be continuous and/or strictly
increasing?

4. Show that, if f and g are density functions, and 0 < A < 1, thenAf + (1 —A)g is a density. Is
the product fg a density function?

5. Which of the following are density functions? Find c and the corresponding distribution function
F for those that are.

2.4 Exercises. Worked examples

1. Let X be a random variable with a continuous distribution function F. Find expressions for the
distribution functions of the following random variables:

(a) X?, (b) VX,
(c) sin X, (d) G-1(X),
(e) F(X), (f) G-!(F(X)),

where G is a continuous and strictly increasing function.

2. Truncation. Let X be a random variable with distribution function F,, and let a < b. Sketch the
distribution functions of the ‘truncated’ random variables Y and Z given by

a if X <a,
Y= < X ifa<X <b,

{x tik s
Z=
b ifX>b,

0 if|X|>b.

Indicate how these distribution functions behave as a > —oo, b > oo.
