[(13.12.14]-[13.12.18] Solutions Diffusion processes

14. By an extension of It6’s formula to functions of two Wiener processes, U = u(W ,, W2) and
V = v(W,, W2) satisfy

dU = uz dW, + uy dW + f(uxx + Wyy) dt,

dV =v, dW, + vy dW + Axx + vyy) dt,
where ux, Vyy, etc, denote partial derivatives of u and v. Since ¢ is analytic, u and v satisfy the

Cauchy—Riemann equations ux = vy, 4 = —vx, whence u and v are harmonic in that uy + Uyy =
Uxx + Vyy = 0. Therefore,

dU =uydW,+uydW2, dV =—uydW, +uxydWyo.

of the pair (W,, W2) is invariant under such rotations, the claim follows.

) is an orthogonal rotation of IR? when uz +u5 = 1. Since the joint distribution

15. One method of solution uses the fact that the reversed Wiener process {W(t—s)-W(t):O0<s<
t} has the same distribution as {W(s) : 0 < s <t}. Thus M(t)— W(t) = maxg<s<;{W(s)— W(e)} has
the same distribution as maxp<,<;{W(u) — W(0)} = M(t). Alternatively, by the reflection principle,

P(M(t) > x, W(t) < y) =P(W(t) = 2x —y) forx > max{O, y}.

By differentiation, the pair M(t), W(t) has joint density function —2¢’(2x — y) for y < x, x > 0,
where @ is the density function of the N(0, t) distribution. Hence M(t) and M(t) — W(t) have the
joint density function —2¢’(x + y). Since this function is symmetric in its arguments, M(t) and
M(t) — W(t) have the same marginal distribution.

16. The Lebesgue measure A(Z) is given by

io. ¢)
A(Z) = [ Tiwot)=u} 24,
whence by Fubini’s theorem (cf. equation (5.6.13)),

E(A(Z)) = [ P(W(t) =u) dt =0.

17. LetO0 <a <b <c <d, and let M(x, y) = maxy<s<y W(s). Then

M c,d) — M(a, b) = max { W(s) — Wec)} + {We) — Woe)} - max, { W(s) — Wob)}.

Since the three terms on the right are independent and continuous random variables, it follows that
P((M (c,d) = Ma, b)) = 0. Since there are only countably many rationals, we deduce that
P((M¢c, d) = Mca, b) for all rationals a < b < c < d) = 1, and the result follows.

18. The result is easily seen by exhaustion to be true when n = 1. Suppose it is true for allm <n—1
where n > 2.

(i) If sy < 0, then (whatever the final term of the permutation) the number of positive partial sums and
the position of the first maximum depend only on the remaining n — 1 terms. Equality follows by the
induction hypothesis.
