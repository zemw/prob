Problems Solutions [11.8.18]-[11.8.19]

18. The maximum deficit M, seen up to and including the time of the nth claim satisfies
n
Mn = max{ My SOK - xp} = max{0, Uj, Uy + U2,...,U) + U2 +--+ Un},
j=l

where the X; are the inter-claim times, and U; = K; — X;. We have as in the analysis of G/G/1 that
My, has the same distribution as V, = max{0, Un, Un + Un_1,..-, Un + Un_1 +--+: + U1}, whence
M,, has the same distribution as the (x + 1)th waiting time in a M(A)/G/1 queue with service times
K; and interarrival times X;. The result follows by Theorem (11.3.16).

19. (a) Look for a solution to the detailed balance equations Am; = (i + 1)aj41, 0 <i <-s, to find
that the stationary distribution is given by 7; = (p' /i!)zo.
(b) Let pe be the required fraction. We have by Little’s theorem (10.5.18) that

_ A(%e-1 — Ke)

Po= a =P(%e_1—He), c=2,

and p; = 71, where zs is the probability that channels 1, 2,..., 5 are busy in a queue M/M/s having
the property that further calls are lost when all s servers are occupied.
