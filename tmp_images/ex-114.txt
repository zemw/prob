(b) More generally, let Yn = )~}-9 @jZn—i, Where ag = 1 and aj,..., a, are constants. Find the
spectral density function of Y.

8. Show that the complex-valued stationary process X = {X(t) : —co < t < oo} has a spectral
density function which is bounded and uniformly continuous whenever its autocorrelation function o
is continuous and satisfies oe je(t)| dt < co.

9, Let X = {X, : n > 1} be stationary with constant mean w = E(X,) for all n, and such that
cov(Xo, Xn) > Oasn —> oo. Show that n—! Yj=1 Xj mS, [L.

10. Deduce the strong law of large numbers from an appropriate ergodic theorem.

11, Let Q be a stationary measure on (R’ , BT) where T = {1, 2,...}. Show that Q is ergodic if and

for all Y : R’? — R for which E(Y) exists, where Y; : R? = Ris given by Y;(x) = Y(ri-! (x)). As
usual, t is the natural shift operator on R?.

12. The stationary measure Q on (R? , BT) is called strongly mixing if Q(AN t~" B) > Q(A)Q(B)
asin — oo, forall A, B € B7; as usual, T = {1,2,...} and t is the shift operator on R?. Show that
every strongly mixing measure is ergodic.

13. Ergodic theorem. Let (Q, ¥, P) be a probability space, and let T : 82 — Q be measurable and
measure preserving (i.e., P(T~!A) = P(A) for all A € F). Let X : Q — R be a random variable,
and let X; be given by X;(@) = x(ri-} (w)). Show that

where £ is the o-field of invariant events of T.
If T is ergodic (in that P(A) equals 0 or 1 whenever A is invariant), prove that E(X | £) = E(X)
almost surely.

14. Consider the probability space (Q, ¥, P) where Q = [0, 1), Fis the set of Borel subsets, and P
is Lebesgue measure. Show that the shift T : Q — Q defined by T(x) = 2x (mod 1) is measurable,
measure preserving, and ergodic (in that P(A) equals 0 or 1 if A = T —TA),

Let X : 2 — R be the random variable given by the identity mapping X(w) = w. Show that the

proportion of 1’s, in the expansion of X to base 2, equals 5 almost surely. This is sometimes called

‘Borel’s normal number theorem’.

15. Let g : R — R be periodic with period 1, and uniformly continuous and integrable over [0, 1].
Define Z, = g(X +(n- Da), n > 1, where X is uniform on [0, 1] and a is irrational. Show that,

16. Let X = {X(t) : t > 0} be a non-decreasing random process such that:

(a) X(0) = 0, X takes values in the non-negative integers,

(b) X has stationary independent increments,

(c) the sample paths {X(t, w) : t > 0} have only jump discontinuities of unit magnitude.
Show that X is a Poisson process.
