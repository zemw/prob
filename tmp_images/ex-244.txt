Random walk Solutions [5.3.2]-[5.3.4]

since P(Ag41 | Ay) = P(A | Ao) = p/g for k = 0 by Corollary (5.3.6).
2. (a) We have by Theorem (5.3.1c) that

and the claim follows by equating the coefficients of gk.
(b) It is the case that a, = P(S1S2--- Son % 0) satisfies

with the convention that a = 1. We have used the fact that ultimate return to 0 occurs with probability
1. This sequence has generating function given by

Now equate the coefficients of s2”. (Alternatively, use Exercise (5.1.2) to obtain the generating
function of the a, directly.)

3. Draw a diagram of the square with the letters ABCD in clockwise order. Clearly paa(m) = 0 if
m is odd. The walk is at A after 2n steps if and only if the numbers of leftward and rightward steps are
equal and the numbers of upward and downward steps are equal. The number of ways of choosing

2k horizontal steps out of 2n is (Gn). Hence

Writing Fa(s) for the probability generating function of the time T of first return, we use the
argument which leads to Theorem (5.3.1a) to find that Ga(s) = 1+ Fa(s)Ga(s), and therefore
Fa(s) =1~Ga(sy"}.

4. Write (Xn, Yn) for the position of the particle at time n. It is an elementary calculation to show
that the relations Un, = Xn + Yn, Vn = Xn — Yn define independent simple symmetric random walks
U and V. Now T = min{n : Un, = m)}, and therefore Gr(s) = {s—!(1 — /1—s2)}” for |s| <1
by Theorem (5.3.5).
