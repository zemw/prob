5. This is an immediate consequence of the fact that the interarrival times of a Poisson process are
exponentially distributed, since this specifies the distribution of the process.

8.4 Solutions. Queues

1. We use the lack-of-memory property repeatedly, together with the fact that, if X and Y are
independent exponential variables with respective parameters 4 and yi, then P(X < Y) =A/(A+ 4p).

(a) In this case,

(b) If A < yz, and you pick the quicker server, p = 1 — (4).

2. The given event occurs if the time X to the next arrival is less than ¢, and also less than the time
Y of service of the customer present. Now,

(c) And finally, p =

3. By conditioning on the time of passage of the first vehicle,
a
E(T) = I (x +E(T))Ae* dx + ae,
0

and the result follows. If it takes a time b to cross the other lane, and so a + b to cross both, then, with
an obvious notation,

The latter must be the greater, by a consideration of the problem, or by turgid calculation.

Hence 7, 2%n = Amg/(u—A), and by the lack-of-memory property the mean time spent waiting for
service is p79/(js — 4). An arriving customer joins the queue with probability
