Problems Exercises [4.14.28]-[4.14.34]

Set p = q = 2 to deduce the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality E(XY)? < E(X*)E(Y?).
(b) Minkowski’s inequality. Show that, if p > 1, then

{EX + Y|P)}1/? < {e)xP}l/? 4 {RlyP i} /?.

Note that in both cases your proof need not depend on the continuity of X and Y; deduce that the same
inequalities hold for discrete variables.

28. Let Z be arandom variable. Choose X and Y appropriately in the Cauchy—Schwarz (or Holder)
inequality to show that g(p) = log E|Z? | is a convex function of p on the interval of values of p such
that E]Z?| < co. Deduce Lyapunov’s inequality:

{E|Z" |}!/" > (Bi Z5]}!/5 whenever r > s > 0.

You have shown in particular that, if Z has finite rth moment, then Z has finite sth moment for all
positive s <r.

29. Show that, using the obvious notation, E{E(X | Y, Z)| Y¥} = E(X | Y).

30. Motor cars of unit length park randomly in a street in such a way that the centre of each car, in
turn, is positioned uniformly at random in the space available to it. Let m(x) be the expected number
of cars which are able to park in a street of length x. Show that

1 Xx
ma«tl)= <i {m(y) +m(x — y) +1} dy.

It is possible to deduce that m(x) is about as big as 3x when x is large.

31. Buffon’s needle revisited: Buffon’s noodle.

(a) A plane is ruled by the lines y = nd (n = 0,41,...). A needle with length LZ (< d) is cast
randomly onto the plane. Show that the probability that the needle intersects a line is 2L/(wd).

(b) Now fix the needle and let C be a circle diameter d centred at the midpoint of the needle. Let
4 be a line whose direction and distance from the centre of C are independent and uniformly
distributed on [0, 277] and [0, 5d] respectively. This is equivalent to ‘casting the ruled plane at
random’. Show that the probability of an intersection between the needle and A is 2L/(1d).

(c) Let S be a curve within C having finite length L(S). Use indicators to show that the expected
number of intersections between § and 1 is 2L(S)/(7d).

This type of result is used in stereology, which seeks knowledge of the contents of a cell by studying

its cross sections.

32. Buffon’s needle ingested. In the excitement of calculating 2, Mr Buffon (no relation) inadver-
tently swallows the needle and is X-rayed. If the needle exhibits no preference for direction in the
gut, what is the distribution of the length of its image on the X-ray plate? If he swallowed Buffon’s
cross (see Exercise (4.5.3)) also, what would be the joint distribution of the lengths of the images of
the two arms of the cross?

33. Let X1, X2,...,Xn be independent exponential variables with parameter A, and let Xq1) <
X(2) S +++ S X(n) be their order statistics. Show that

Y=nXqy, Yr=+1—-r)(Xw — Xor-1), l<r<n

are also independent and have the same joint distribution as the X;.

34, Let X(1), X(2), ..., Xn) be the order statistics of a family of independent variables with common
continuous distribution function F’. Show that

F(X) r
Y, = {F(Xq))}", t= {pee », Ll<re<n,
n { (n) } r F(X(-41))
