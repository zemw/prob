[6.9.9]-[6.9.11] Solutions Markov chains

The distribution of T is a mixture of an atom at 0 and the exponential distribution with parameter aA.

9. The number N of sojourns in i has a geometric distribution P(N = k) = fea -—f),k>1,
for some f < 1. The length of each of these sojourns has the exponential distribution with some
parameter g;. By the independence of these lengths, the total time T in state i has moment generating

function A
(oT lq _ (85 ) __si—f)
)= vy -A (35) =sq-yp70

The distribution of T is exponential with parameter g;(1 — f).

10. The jump chain is the simple random walk with probabilities 4. /(A + 2) and z/(A + 2), and with
Poi = 1. By Corollary (5.3.6), the chance of ever hitting 0 having started at 1 is 4/4, whence the
probability of returning to 0 having started there is f = 4/A. By the result of Exercise (6.9.9),

A— pb

E(e9%) =
(e""°) are,

as required. Having started at 0, the walk visits the state r > 1 with probability 1. The probability of
returning to r having started there is

and each sojourn is exponentially distributed with parameter gy = A + yw. Now g-(1 — fr) =A-— Bp,

The probability of ever reaching 0 from X (0) is ({z/ )* ©), and the time spent there subsequently
is exponential with parameter 4 — yz. Therefore, the mean total time spent at 0 is

11. (a) The imbedded chain has transition probabilities

hej = { 8kj/8k KF j,
J 0 ifk = j,

where g, = —gxg. Therefore, for any state /,

m key TSK (BK; /8k) 1; 8j ~
So ghey = = = Fj,
yi 8: Doi Ti8i

where we have used the fact that G = 0. Also i, > Oand >>, 7 = 1, and therefore # isa stationary
distribution of Y.

Clearly #% = xy for all k if and only if g, = >>; 7:8; for all k, which is to say that g; = gx for
all pairs i, k. This requires that the ‘holding times’ have the same distribution.
(b) Let T, be the time of the nth change of value of X, with To = 0, and let Un, = T,41 — Tn. Fixa
state k, and let H = min{n > 1: Z, = kj}. Let y;(&) be the mean time spent in state i between two
consecutive visits to k, and let 7;(k) be the mean number of visits to i by the jump chain in between two
