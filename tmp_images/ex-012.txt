Independence Exercises [1.4.6]-[1.5.7]

choose, but your chosen door is not opened immediately. Instead, the presenter opens another door
to reveal a goat, and he offers you the opportunity to change your choice to the third door (unopened
and so far unchosen). Let p be the (conditional) probability that the third door conceals the car. The
value of p depends on the presenter’s protocol. Devise protocols to yield the values p = 5: p= Z.

Show that, for a € (5, 3, there exists a protocol such that p = a. Are you well advised to change
your choice to the third door?

(b) In a variant of this question, the presenter is permitted to open the first door chosen, and to reward
you with whatever lies behind. If he chooses to open another door, then this door invariably conceals
a goat. Let p be the probability that the unopened door conceals the car, conditional on the presenter
having chosen to open a second door. Devise protocols to yield the values p = 0, p = 1, and deduce
that, for any a € [0, 1], there exists a protocol with p = a.

6. The prosecutor’s fallacy}. Let G be the event that an accused is guilty, and T the event that
some testimony is true. Some lawyers have argued on the assumption that P(G | T) = P(T | G).
Show that this holds if and only if P(G) = P(T).

7. Urns. There are n urns of which the rth contains r — 1 red balls and n — r magenta balls. You
pick an urn at random and remove two balls at random without replacement. Find the probability that:
(a) the second ball is magenta;

(b) the second ball is magenta, given that the first is magenta.

1.5 Exercises. Independence

1, Let A and B be independent events; show that A°, B are independent, and deduce that A°, B®
are independent.

2. We roll a die n times. Let Aj; be the event that the ith and jth rolls produce the same number.

Show that the events {A;; : 1 <i < j <x} are pairwise independent but not independent.

3. A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Show that the following two statements are equivalent:

(a) the outcomes of different tosses are independent,

(b) for any given finite sequence of heads and tails, the chance of this sequence occurring in the first
m tosses is 2~”, where m is the length of the sequence.

4, LetQ={1,2,..., p} where p is prime, ¥ be the set of all subsets of Q, and P(A) = |A|/p for
all A € ¥. Show that, if A and B are independent events, then at least one of A and B is either @ or
Q.

5. Show that the conditional independence of A and B given C neither implies, nor is implied by,
the independence of A and B. For which events C is it the case that, for all A and B, the events A and
B are independent if and only if they are conditionally independent given C?

6. Safe or sorry? Some form of prophylaxis is said to be 90 per cent effective at prevention during
one year’s treatment. If the degrees of effectiveness in different years are independent, show that the
treatment is more likely than not to fail within 7 years.

7. Families, Jane has three children, each of which is equally likely to be a boy or a girl independently
of the others. Define the events:

A = {all the children are of the same sex},
B = {there is at most one boy},
C = {the family includes a boy and a girl}.

+The prosecution made this error in the famous Dreyfus case of 1894.
