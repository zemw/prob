Problems Solutions [6.15.7]-[6.15.8]

Suppose Xo = i, and note that (1 — f;;)pjj(m) < 1 — fiz, since if the chain visits j at time m
and subsequently does not return to i, then no return to i takes place at all. However fj; = 1 ifi is
persistent, so that fj; = 1.

7. (a) We may take S = {0, 1,2, ...}. Note that g;;(”) > 0, and
[o.@)
Sai =1, gat) => auDayo,
j 1=0

whence Q = (qj; (1)) is the transition matrix of a Markov chain, and Q” = (qj; (#)). This chain is
persistent since

So ai) => pi) =00 forall,
n n
and irreducible since i communicates with j in the new chain whenever j communicates with i in the
original chain.
That

is evident when n = 1 since both sides are qj; (1). Suppose it is true for n = m where m > 1. Now

which equals g;; (mm + 1) as required.
(b) Sum () over n to obtain that

where 0;(j) is the mean number of visits to i between two visits to 7; we have used the fact that
yen 81j (2) = 1, since the chain is persistent (see Problem (6.15.6)). It follows that x; = xo; (0) for
all i, and therefore x is unique up to a multiplicative constant.

(c) The claim is trivial when i = j, and we assume therefore that i 4 j. Let N;(j) be the number
of visits to i before reaching j for the first time, and write Py and Ex for probability and expectation
conditional on Xo = k. Clearly, Pj(Nj (Vj) 2) = Aji — Ay! for r > 1, whence

The claim follows by (««),
