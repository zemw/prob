The ergodic theorem Solutions [9.4.1]-[9.5.2]

9.4 Solutions. Stochastic integration and the spectral representation

1. Let Hy be the space of all linear combinations of the X;, and let Hx be the closure of this space,
that is, Hy together with the limits of all mean-square Cauchy-convergent sequences in Hy. All
members of Hy have zero mean, and therefore all members of Hy also. Now S(A) € Hy forall A,
whence E(S(A) — S(j)) = 0 for all A and yu.

2. First, each Yj, lies in the space Hy containing all linear combinations of the X, and all limits of
mean-square Cauchy-convergent sequences of the same form. As in the solution to Exercise (9.4.1),
all members of Hy have zero mean, and therefore E(Y¥) = 0 for all m. Secondly,

This proves that such a sequence X, may be expressed as a moving average of an orthonormal
sequence.

3. Let Hy be the space of all linear combinations of the X,, together with all limits of (mean-
square) Cauchy-convergent sequences of such combinations. Using the result of Problem (7.11.19),
all elements in Hy are normally distributed. In particular, all increments of the spectral process are
normal. Similarly, all pairs in Hy are jointly normally distributed, and therefore two members of
Hy are independent if and only if they are uncorrelated. Increments of the spectral process have
zero means (by Exercise (9.4.1)) and are orthogonal. Therefore they are uncorrelated, and hence
independent.

9.5 Solutions. The ergodic theorem

“1. With the usual shift operator tr, it is obvious that tg =@, so that @ € J. Secondly, if A € 2,
then t~!(A°) = (r~!A)® = A®, whence A° € £. Thirdly, suppose Ay, Az,... € £. Then

oo lo. @) lo. @)
YU Ai) =(Jrta =U A.
i=l i=l i=l

so that 7° A; € J.

2. The left-hand side is the sum of covariances, c(0) appearing n times, and c(i) appearing 2(n — i)
times for 0 < i <n, in agreement with the right-hand side.

Lete > 0. Ifé(j) = j7! i c(i) > o7 as j —> 00, there exists J such that |¢(j) —o2| <
when j > J. Now

2S a =f e+ 3 i(o? +o} +0? +e
j=l j=l j=J+l

asn — oo. A related lower bound is proved similarly, and the claim follows since € (> 0) is arbitrary.
