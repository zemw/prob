the Poisson distribution. Assume that “reasonably confident that n is all" means that P(X > n |X >
n) < r for some suitable small number r. Assuming the Poisson approximation, P(X > n) < rP(X =
n) if and only if

k=n+1 — kan
For any given r, the smallest acceptable value of n may be determined numerically. If r is small, then
very roughly n x 1/r will do (e.g., ifr = 0.05 then n ~ 20).
(d) No level p of improbability is sufficiently small for one to be sure that the person is specified
uniquely. If p = 10~’q, then X is bin(10’, 10~7a), which is approximately Poisson with parameter
a, Therefore, in this case,

An acceptable value of p for a very petty offence might be p ~ 0.05, in which case a ~ 0.1 and so
p = 10-8 might be an acceptable level of improbability. For a capital offence, one would normally
require a much smaller value of p. We note that the rules of evidence do not allow an overt discussion
along these lines in a court of law in the United Kingdom.

22. The number G of girls has the binomial distribution bin(Qn, p). Hence

With p = 0.485 and n = 10*, we have using Stirling’s formula (Exercise (3.10.1)) that

It follows that the probability that boys outnumber girls for 82 successive years is at least (1 — 1.23 x
107>)®2 > 0.99899.

23. Let M be the number of such visits. If k 4 0, then M > 1 if and only if the particle hits 0 before
it hits N, an event with probability 1 — kKN—! by equation (1.7.7). Having hit 0, the chance of another
visit to 0 before hitting N is 1 — N—!, since the particle at 0 moves immediately to 1 whence there is
probability 1 — N —1 of another visit to 0 before visiting N. Hence
