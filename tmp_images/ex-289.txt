[6.3.10]-[6.3.10] Solutions Markov chains

There are only finitely many subsets of entries of P, and so there exists f(n) such that R(P) < f(n)
for all relevant n x n transition matrices P.

(c) Consider the two chains with diagrams in the figure beneath. In the case on the left, we have that
P11(5) = 9, and in the case on the right, we may apply the postage stamp lemma with a = n and

b=n-1.

when Xp = j. By conditioning on the first removal,

By the result of Exercise (6.3.6), we seek the minimal non-negative solution (e;) to (+), which is
attained when 2(1 — e;) = 1, that is, ey = 4. Hence

For the second part, let d; be the expected time until j — 1 green balls remain, having started with j
green balls and j + 2 red. We condition as above to obtain

We set ej = dj — (2j + 1) to find that (j + 2)e; = jej41, whence e; = 5iG + 1)e;. The expected

The minimal non-negative solution is found by setting e; = 0, and the conclusion follows by Exercise
(6.3.7).
