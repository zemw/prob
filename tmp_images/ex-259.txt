(b) Let {X; : i => 1} be a collection of independent Poisson random variables, each with parameter 1.
Then Sp = 5-7 X; is Poisson with parameter n, and by the central limit theorem

2. Asuperficiaily plausible argument asserts that, if all babies look the same, then the number X of
correct answers in 7 trials is a random variable with the bin(n, 5) distribution. Then, for large n,

by the central limit theorem. For the given values of n and X,

X—jn 910-750 _
Lyn 5/15

Now we might say that the event {X — in > 3/n } is sufficiently unlikely that its occurrence casts
doubt on the original supposition that babies look the same.

A statistician would level a good many objections at drawing such a clear cut decision from such
murky data, but this is beyond our scope to elaborate.

3. Clearly

_ itY _ it _ _ 1 oo 1 \°
by () = E{E(e®” | X)} = Efexp(X(e — ))} = (; - 5) = & =) .
It follows that 1
E(Y) = 540) =, E(Y?) = —o-(0) = s? 42s,

whence var(Y) = 2s. Therefore the characteristic function of the normalized variable Z = (Y —
EY)/./var(Y) is
z(t) = et VS/* by (t/V25).

Now,
log { dy (t/W2s)} = —s log (2 — eit/V2s) =s (eit/V2s -1)+ 1 5 (eit/V2s = 1)° +o(1)
= ity/ ts — de? — bt? + 0c),
where the o(1) terms are as s — oo. Hence log{¢z(t)} > —3t
by the continuity theorem (5.9.5).
Let P,, P2, ... be an infinite sequence of independent Poisson variables with parameter 1. Then
Sn = Pi + Po +-+-+ Pn is Poisson with parameter n. Now Y has the Poisson distribution with
parameter X, and so Y is distributed as Sy. Also, X has the same distribution as the sum of s
independent exponential variables, implying that X —> oo as s — oo, with probability 1. This

suggests by the central limit theorem that Sy (and hence Y also) is approximately normal in the limit
as 5 —> 00. We have neglected the facts that s and X are not generally integer valued.

2ass > oo, and the result follows

4, Since X, is non-arithmetic, there exist integers n,,2,...,"% with greatest common divisor 1
