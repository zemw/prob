Since the height of P is uniformly distributed on [0, a], we have that

11a?
108 °

1 a
mp(a) = -{f b(x) dx =

We substitute this into the differential equation to obtain the solution m(a) = Tha.

Turning to the last part, by making an affine transformation, we may without loss of generality
take the parallelogram to be a square. The points form a convex quadrilateral when no point lies

inside the triangle formed by the other three, and the required probability is therefore 1 — 4m(a)/a? =
1-7 = %.

61. Choose four points P, Q, R, S uniformly at random inside C, and let 7 be the event that their
convex hull is a triangle. By considering which of the four points lies in the interior of the convex
hull of the other three, we see that P(T) = 4P(S € PQR) = 4E|PQR|/|C|. Having chosen P, Q, R,
the four points form a triangle if and only if S lies in either the triangle PQR or the shaded region A.
Thus, P(7) = {|A| + E|PQR]}/|C|, and the claim follows on solving for P(7).

62. Since X has zero means and covariance matrix I, we have that E(Z) = ye + ECX)L = ym, and the
covariance matrix of Z is E(L’X’XL) = L/IL = V.
63. Let D = (dj) = AB — C. The claim is trivial if D = 0, and so we assume the converse. Choose
i, k such that dj, ¢ 0, and write yj; = Vi=l djjxj = S + digxy. Now P(yj = 0) = E(P(xx =
—S/dix | S)). For any given S, there is probability at least 5 that x, 4 —S/dj,, and the second claim
follows.

Let x1, X2,..-,Xm be independent random vectors with the given distribution. If D 4 0, the

probability that Dx; = 0 for 1 < 5s < mis at most 4)”, which may be made as small as required by
choosing m sufficiently large.
