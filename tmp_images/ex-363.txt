[8.7.4]-[8.7.6] Solutions Random processes

4, We have that

Ah + oth) if j=i+,

an immigration—death process with constant birth rate 1. and death rates 4; = ip.

Either calculate the stationary distribution in the usual way, or use the fact that birth-death
processes are reversible in equilibrium. Hence Ax; = wi + 1)2j+.1 fori > 0, whence

5. We have that X (t) = Rcos(V) cos(6t) — Rsin(¥) sin(6t). Consider the transformation u =
rcos wv, v = —r sin wy, which maps [0, 00) x [0, 277) to R2. The Jacobian is

whence U = Rcos WV, V = —Rsin W have joint density function satisfying

Substitute fy,y(u,v) =e 2 /(2x), to obtain

Thus R and W are independent, the latter being uniform on [0, 27).

6. Accustomer arriving at time u is designated green if he is in state A at time ¢, an event having
probability p(u, t —u). By the colouring theorem (6.13.14), the arrival times of green customers form
a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity function 4(u)p(u, t — u), and the claim follows.
