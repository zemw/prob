[3.11.30]-[3.11.34] Solutions Discrete random variables

In either case the claim is proved.

30. (a) Not much.

(b) The rhyme may be interpreted in any of several ways. Interpreting it as meaning that families stop
at their first son, we may represent the sample space of a typical family as {B, GB, G2B, ...}, with
P(G"B) = 2—-+D_ The mean number of girls is 7°, nP(G"B) = S702, n2-“+) = 1; there is
exactly one boy.

The empirical sex ratio for large populations will be near to 1:1, by the law of large numbers.
However the variance of the number of girls in a typical family is var(#girls) = 2, whilst var(#boys) =
0; #A denotes the cardinality of A. Considerable variation from 1:1 is therefore possible in smaller
populations, but in either direction. In a large number of small populations, the number of large
predominantly female families would be balanced by a large number of male singletons.

31. Any positive integer m has a unique factorization in the form m = []; pro for non-negative
integers m(1), m(2),.... Hence,

1 1 _mi)\2 = C
Pa =m =[] 70 =m) =I (1-25) res = (IL °) =3

i i i i

where C = [];(1 — p)’). Now >>, P(M = m) = 1, so thatC-! = >, mF.

32. Number the plates 0, 1,2, ..., N where 0 is the starting plate, fix k satisfying 0 < k < N, and
let Ax be the event that plate number k is the last to be visited. In order to calculate P(A), we cut
the table open at k, and bend its outside edge into a line segment, along which the plate numbers read
k,k+1,...,N,0,1,...,k in order. It is convenient to relabel the plates as —(N + 1 — k), -(N —
k),...,—-1,0,1,...,k. Now Ag occurs if and only if a symmetric random walk, starting from 0,
visits both —(N — k) and k — 1 before it visits either —(N + 1 — k) ork. Suppose it visits —(N — k)
before it visits k — 1. The (conditional) probability that it subsequently visits k — 1 before visiting
—(N + 1 -— k) is the same as the probability that a symmetric random walk, starting from 1, hits N
before it hits 0, a probability of N~! by (1.7.7). The same argument applies if the cake visits k — 1
before it visits —(N — k). Therefore P(A,) = N “1,

33. With j denoting the jth best vertex, the walk has transition probabilities pj, = (j — 1)~! for
1<k < j. By conditional expectation,

j-1

1
alts te r, = 0.

Induction now supplies the result. Since r; ~ log j for large j, the worst-case expectation is about
log (7).
34. Let py denote the required probability. If (n;,m,4+,) is first pair to make a dimer, then m
is ultimately uncombined with probability p,_,. By conditioning on the first pair, we find that
Pn = (Pi + p2 +-+> + Pn—2)/(n — 1), giving 2(Pnt1 — Pn) = —(Pn — Pn—1). Therefore,
(Pati — Pn) = (-1)"7!(p2 — pt) = (—1)", and the claim follows by summing.

Finally,

n
EUn = >_ P(m, is uncombined) = pn + py Pn—1 + +++ + Pn—1P1 + Pn,
r=]

since the rth molecule may be thought of as an end molecule of two sequences of lengthr andn—r-+1.
Now pn > e~/asn —> oo, and itis an easy exercise of analysis to obtain that n'EU, > e,
