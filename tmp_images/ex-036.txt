Problems Exercises [3.11.31]-{3.11.37]

Hence all these surplus women, QED.

(a) What do you think of the argument?

(b) Show that the mean number of children of either sex in a family whose fertile parents have
followed this policy equals 1. (You should assume that each delivery yields exactly one child
whose sex is equally likely to be male or female.) Discuss.

31. Let B > 1, let pj, po,... denote the prime numbers, and let N(1), N(2), ... be independent

random variables, N(i) having mass function P(N (i) = k) = (A — vive for k > 0, where y; = P; B
for all i. Show that M = [[S°, p)" is a random integer with mass function P(M = m) = Cm~8
for m > 1 (this may be called the Dirichlet distribution), where C is a constant satisfying

m=1

32. N+ 1 plates are laid out around a circular dining table, and a hot cake is passed between them in
the manner of a symmetric random walk: each time it arrives on a plate, it is tossed to one of the two
neighbouring plates, each possibility having probability S. The game stops at the moment when the
cake has visited every plate at least once. Show that, with the exception of the plate where the cake
began, each plate has probability 1/N of being the last plate visited by the cake.

33. Simplex algorithm. There are (7) points ranked in order of merit with no matches. You seek to
reach the best, B. If you are at the jth best, you step to any one of the j — 1 better points, with equal
probability of stepping to each. Let rj be the expected number of steps to reach B from the jth best

vertex. Show that r; = ia k—!, Give an asymptotic expression for the expected time to reach B
from the worst vertex, for large m,n.

34, Dimer problem. There are n unstable molecules in a row, m,,m2,... , mn. One of then — 1
pairs of neighbours, chosen at random, combines to form a stable dimer; this process continues until
there remain U;, isolated molecules no two of which are adjacent. Show that the probability that m
remains isolated is (-))"/ris e—! asn — oo. Deduce that limy—+oo n— EU, =e ?,

35. Poisson approximation. Let {7, : 1 <r <n} be independent Bernoulli random variables with
respective parameters {py : 1 <r <n} satisfying py <c < 1forallr andsomec. LetA = 7?_, pr
and X = 5°?_, Xr. Show that

36. Sampling. The length of the tail of the rth member of a troop of N chimeras is xy. A random
sample of n chimeras is taken (without replacement) and their tails measured. Let J; be the indicator
of the event that the rth chimera is in the sample. Set

Show that E(Y) = y, and var(Y) = (N —n)o2/{n(N — 1}.

37. Berkson’s fallacy. Any individual in a group G contracts a certain disease C with probability
y; such individuals are hospitalized with probability c. Independently of this, anyone in G may be
in hospital with probability a, for some other reason. Let X be the number in hospital, and Y the
