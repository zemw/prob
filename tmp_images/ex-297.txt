[6.6.3]-[6.6.4] Solutions Markov chains

where 6;; is the Kronecker delta. Let v = (0,0,...,0,1) € R”+1. If statement (ii) of the question
is valid, there exists y = (1, y2,.-., Y¥m+1) such that

m
ymt1 <0 => (pij — 8i)¥j + ym41 = O for 1 <i <m;
j=l

this implies that

m
So py) ZV —Ym4i > yi — forall,
j=l
and hence the impossibility that Ljel Pij yj > max;{y;}. It follows that statement (i) holds, which
is to say that there exists a non-negative vector x = (x1,%2,.-..,m) such that x(P — I) = 0 and

>. xi = 1; such an x is the required eigenvector.

3. Thinking of x,41 as the amount you may be sure of winning, you seek a betting scheme x such
that x,41 1s maximized subject to the inequalities

n
Xn41 = So xitiy forl <j <m.
i=1

Writing aj; = —tj; for 1 <i <n and a,41,; = 1, we obtain the linear program:
atl
maximize X,+41 subject to So xii <0 forl<j<m.
i=]
The dual linear program is:

m
minimize 0 subject to So aij yj =0 forl <i<n,
j=l

m
Se an41,j)% =1, y2=0 forl<j<m.
j=l

Re-expressing the a;; in terms of the t;; as above, the dual program takes the form:

m
minimize 0 subject to So tj Pj =0 forl <i<a,
j=l
m
pj=1, pj=90 forl<j<m.
j=l

The vector x = 0 is a feasible solution of the primal program. The dual program has a feasible
solution if and only if statement (a) holds. Therefore, if (a) holds, the dual program has minimal value
0, whence by the duality theorem of linear programming, the maximal value of the primal program is
0, in contradiction of statement (b). On the other hand, if (a) does not hold, the dual has no feasible
solution, and therefore the primal program has no optimal solution. That is, the objective function of
the primal is unbounded, and therefore (b) holds. [This was proved by De Finetti in 1937.]

4. Use induction, the claim being evidently true when n = 1. Suppose it is true for n = m. Certainly
p+! is of the correct form, and the equation P’”+1x/ = P(P” x’) with x = (1, @, w”) yields in its
first row

1 m+1 + 42,m41@ + 43, m410 = (1 — pt po)” (Px’); = (1 — p + poy" t
