5.7 Exercises. Characteristic functions

1. Find two dependent random variables X and Y such that dy+y(t) = $x (t)dy (1) for all ¢.

2. If @ is a characteristic function, show that Re{1 — @(f)} > 4Re{1 — $(2t)}, and deduce that
1 — |@(2t)| < 8{1 — |¢@)]}-
3. The cumulant generating function Ky (@) of the random variable X is defined by Ky (9) =

log E(e°*), the logarithm of the moment generating function of X. If the latter is finite in a neigh-
bourhood of the origin, then Kx has a convergent Taylor expansion:

Kx@) = | kn (X)0"

n=1

and ky, (X) is called the nth cumulant (or semi-invariant) of X.
(a) Express ky (X), k2(X), and k3(X) in terms of the moments of X.
(b) If X and Y are independent random variables, show that k,(X + Y) = ky(X) + kn (Y¥).

4. Let X be N(O, 1), and show that the cumulants of X are kp(X) = 1, km(X) = 0 for m £2.

5. Therandom variable X is said to have a lattice distribution if there exist a and b such that X takes
values in the set L(a, b) = {a +bm:m =0,+1,...}. The span of such a variable X is the maximal
value of b for which there exists a such that X takes values in L(a, b).

(a) Suppose that X has a lattice distribution with span b. Show that |@x(27/b)| = 1, and that
ldx(t)| < 1 forO <t < 2n/b.

(b) Suppose that |¢x(@)| = 1 for some 6 + 0. Show that X has a lattice distribution with span
27k/@ for some integer k.

6. Let X bea random variable with density function f. Show that |¢x(t)| > 0 ast > oo.

7. LetX, X2,..., X, be independent variables, X; being N(j4;, 1), andlet Y = X7+X3+---+X2.
Show that the characteristic function of Y is

where 0 = ut + ws feet we. The random variables Y is said to have the non-central chi-squared
distribution with n degrees of freedom and non-centrality parameter 0, written x2(n; 6).

8 Let X be N(u, 1) and let Y be x2(n), and suppose that X and Y are independent. The random
variable T = X/./Y/n is said to have the non-central t-distribution with n degrees of freedom and
non-centrality parameter jz. If U and V are independent, U being x*(m; @) and V being x7(n), then
F = (U/m)/(V/n) is said to have the non-central F-distribution with m and n degrees of freedom
and non-centrality parameter 6, written F (m,n; 0).

(a) Show that T? is F(1, n; 27).

(b) Show that
