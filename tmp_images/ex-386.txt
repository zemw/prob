where a(t) = | (t/) + xx/to2/u3|. Now,

P(Taq) <0) =P (2 ~ Ha) i a)

o/a(t) ~ o/a(t)
However a(t) ~ t/j as t —> oo, and therefore

t — pa(t)

x ast > oO,
o/a(t)

implying by the usual central limit theorem that

P N(t) — (¢/)
Vto2/p>
where ® is the N(O, 1) distribution function.
An alternative proof makes use of Anscombe’s theorem (7.11.28).

4, We have that, for y < f,

by Exercise (10.3.3a). The current and excess lifetimes have the same asymptotic distributions.

5. Using the lack-of-memory property of the Poisson process, the current lifetime C(t) is independent
of the excess lifetime E(t), the latter being exponentially distributed with parameter 4. To derive the
density function of C(t) either solve (without difficulty in this case) the relevant integral equation, or
argue as follows. Looking backwards in time from f, the arrival process looks like a Poisson process
up to distance f¢ (at the origin) where it stops. Therefore C(t) may be expressed as min{Z, t} where Z
is exponential with parameter 1; hence

and P(C(t) = t) = e7**. Now D(t) = C(t) + E(2), whose distribution is easily found (by the
convolution formula) to be as given.

6. The ith interarrival time may be expressed in the form T + Z; where Z; is exponential with
parameter A. In addition, Z,, Zz, ... are independent, by the lack-of-memory property. Now

1-F(@x) =P(T+Z,>x)=WMZ)>x—-T)=e%F-), x>T.

Taking into account the (conventional) dead period beginning at time 0, we have that

where N is a Poisson process.

7. We have that X} = L + E(L) where L is the length of the dead period beginning at 0, and E(L)
is the excess lifetime at L. Therefore, conditioning on L,

P(X, <x) = [ P(E@) <x-1)dF,@.
