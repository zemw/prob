[4.14.60]-[4.14.60] Solutions Continuous random variables

where 6;, is the Kronecker delta, since C is orthogonal. It follows that the set of vectors Y, has the
same joint distribution as the set of X;. Since C is orthogonal, X;, = ~?_, csr Yis, and therefore

This has the same distribution as 7;; because the Y, and the X; are identically distributed.

60. We sketch this. Let E[PQR| = m(a), and use Crofton’s method. A point randomly dropped in
S(a + da) lies in S(a) with probability

where m,(a) is the conditional mean of |PQR| given that P is constrained to lie on the boundary of
S(a). Let b(x) be the conditional mean of |PQR| given that P lies a distance x down one vertical
edge.

By conditioning on whether Q and R lie above or beneath P we find, in an obvious notation, that

By Exercise (4.13.6) (see also Exercise (4.13.7), mr,,R, = 4(4a)(5a) = }a?. In order to find
m r,, we condition on whether Q and R lie in the triangles 7; or 72, and use an obvious notation.

Recalling Example (4.13.6), we have that m7, = mp, = H . jax. Next, arguing as we did in
that example,
M7, ,T) = 5 : g {ax - 4ax - dax - fax}.

Hence, by conditional expectation,
