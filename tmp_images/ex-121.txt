11.2 Exercises. M/M/1

1, Consider a random walk on the non-negative integers with a reflecting barrier at 0, and which
moves rightwards or leftwards with respective probabilities o/(1 + 9) and 1/(1 + e); when at 0, the
particle moves to 1 at the next step. Show that the walk has a stationary distribution if and only if
p < 1, and in this case the unique such distribution z is given by 7p = 4 (1— ?),%, = 4 (1—p?)p" 7!
forn > 1.

2. Suppose now that the random walker of Exercise (1) delays its steps in the following way. When
at the point n, it waits a random length of time having the exponential distribution with parameter
6, before moving to its next position; different ‘holding times’ are independent of each other and of
further information concerning the steps of the walk. Show that, subject to reasonable assumptions
on the @,, the ensuing continuous-time process settles into an equilibrium distribution v given by
Vn = Crp /Oy, for some appropriate constant C.

By applying this result to the case when 69 = A, 6, = A+ forn > 1, deduce that the equilibrium
distribution of the M(A)/M(z)/1 queue is vz = (1 — e)p”, n > 0, where p = A/p < 1.

3. Waiting time. Consider a M(A)/M(jz)/1 queue with o = 1/, satisfying p < 1, and suppose that
the number Q(0) of people in the queue at time 0 has the stationary distribution x, = (1 — p)p”,
n > 0. Let W be the time spent by a typical new arrival before he begins his service. Show that the
distribution of W is given by P(W < x) = 1— pe *#-A) for x > 0, and note that P(W = 0) = 1—p.

4. A box contains i red balls and j lemon balls, and they are drawn at random without replacement.
Each time a red (respectively lemon) ball is drawn, a particle doing a walk on {0, 1,2, ...} moves
one step to the right (respectively left); the origin is a retaining barrier, so that leftwards steps from
the origin are suppressed. Let (n; i, 7) be the probability that the particle ends at position n, having
started at the origin. Write down a set of difference equations for the (n; i, j), and deduce that

u(n;i, jf) =AM;i,j)-Amt+lij) fori<jtna

where A(n;i, j) = ()/ CP").

5. Let Q be a M(A)/M(2)/1 queue with Q(0) = 0. Show that p,(t) = P(Q(t) = n) satisfies

where the m(n; i, j) are given in the previous exercise.

6. Let Q(t) be the length of an M(A)/M(yz)/1 queue at time t, and let Z = {Z,} be the jump chain
of Q. Explain how the stationary distribution of Q@ may be derived from that of Z, and vice versa.
