(11.5.3]-[11.7.2] Solutions Queues

It may of course be shown that ¢ is the smallest positive root of the equation x = My (ux - 1),
where X is a typical interarrival time.

3. We have that
OO
1- Gy) =PS-x> y= | PS >uty)dFy(u), yeR,
0
where S and X are typical (independent) service and interarrival times. Hence, formally,

[o-e) OO
dG(y) = -| dP(S > u+y)dFx(u) = ay [ pe #UtY) ary (u),
0 —y
since fg(u + y) =e HU+Y) if u > —y, and is 0 otherwise.
With F as given,

x
/ F(x — y)dG(y) = | // {1 — ne HAM} pe“ BUTY) d Fy (u) dy.
oo —oo<y<x

—y<u<0o

First integrate over y, then over u (noting that Fy (u) = O for u < 0), and the double integral collapses
to F(x), when x > 0.

11.6 Solution. Heavy traffic

1. Qp has characteristic function

O° .
bot) = pep" — p) =

n=0
Therefore the characteristic function of (1 — )Qp satisfies

l1-p 1
b0( et) = — imp ToT

The limit characteristic function is that of the exponential distribution, and the result follows by the
continuity theorem.

11.7 Solutions. Networks of queues

1. The first observation follows as in Example (11.7.4). The equilibrium distribution is given as in
Theorem (11.7.14) by

Nima:

x(n) = [| ao ; form = (n1,n2,...,Mc) € Z,

i=]
the product of Poisson distributions. This is related to Bartlett’s theorem (see Problem (8.7.6)) by
defining the state A as ‘being in station i at some given time’.

2. The number of customers in the queue is a birth-death process, and is therefore reversible in
equilibrium. The claims follow in the same manner as was argued in the solution to Exercise (11.2.7).
