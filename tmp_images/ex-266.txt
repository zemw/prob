Problems Solutions [5.12.9]-[5.12.11]

Write fu) = G0 +4),x =s—1, y =t —1, to obtain f(px + qy) = f (px) f (gy), a functional
equation valid at least when —2 < x, y < 0. Now f is continuous within its disc of convergence,
and also f(0) = 1; the usual argument (see Problem (4.14.5)) implies that f(x) = e for some
A, and therefore G(s) = f(s — 1) = e*“—)_ Therefore X + Y has the Poisson distribution with
parameter 4. Furthermore, Gx(s) = G(ps +q) =e? (s~l) whence X has the Poisson distribution
with parameter Ap. Similarly Y has the Poisson distribution with parameter Aq.

9. In the usual notation, G,41(s) = Gn(G(s)). It follows that Gri) = G"(1)6'(1)? +

10. (a) Since the coin is unbiased, we may assume that each player, having won a round, continues
to back the same face (heads or tails) until losing. The duration D of the game equals k if and only
if k is the first time at which there has been either a run of r — 1 heads or a run of r — 1 tails; the
probability of this may be evaluated in a routine way. Alternatively, argue as follows. We record S
(for ‘same’) each time a coin shows the same face as its predecessor, and we record C (for ‘change’)
otherwise; start with a C. It is easy to see that each symbol in the resulting sequence is independent
of earlier symbols and is equally likely to be S or C. Now D = k if and only if the first run of r — 2
S’s is completed at time k. It is immediate from the result of Problem (5.12.3) that

Let @ be a complex (r — 1)th root of unity, and set

It may be seen (as for Problem (5.12.2)) that the coefficient of st in W,;(s) is P(D = i) if i is of the
form n(r — 1) + (k — 1) for some n, and is 0 otherwise. Therefore P(A, wins) = W;(1).

(c) The pool contains £D when it is won. The required mean is therefore

E(Dia, wins}) _ Ww.)

E(D | Ay wins) = =

(d) Using the result of Exercise (5.1.2), the generating function of the sequence P(D > k), k > 0, is
T(s) =(1 — Gp(s))/(1 — 5). The required probability is the coefficient of s” in T(s).
