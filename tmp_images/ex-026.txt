Expectation Exercises [3.2.3]-[3.3.5]

3. Let X1, X2, X3 be independent random variables taking values in the positive integers and having
mass functions given by P(X; = x) = (1 — pip forx = 1,2,..., andi = 1, 2,3.
(a) Show that
(1 — p1)(1 — pa) pap5
(1 — pop3)(l — pip2p3)

P(X, < X2 < X3) =

(b) Find P(X) < Xz < X3).
4. Three players, A, B, and C, take turns to roll a die; they do this in the order ABCABCA....
(a) Show that the probability that, of the three players, A is the first to throw a 6, B the second, and
C the third, is 216/1001.
(b) Show that the probability that the first 6 to appear is thrown by A, the second 6 to appear is thrown
by B, and the third 6 to appear is thrown by C, is 46656/753571.
5. Let X,,1 <r <n, be independent random variables which are symmetric about 0; that is,
X, and —X, have the same distributions. Show that, for all x, P(S, > x) = P(S, < —x) where
Sn = or Xr.
Is the conclusion necessarily true without the assumption of independence?

3.3 Exercises. Expectation

1. Is it generally true that E(1/X) = 1/E(X)? Is it ever true that E(1/X) = 1/E(X)?

2. Coupons. Every package of some intrinsically dull commodity includes a small and exciting

plastic object. There are c different types of object, and each package is equally likely to contain any

given type. You buy one package each day.

(a) Find the mean number of days which elapse between the acquisitions of the jth new type of object
and the (j + 1)th new type.

(b) Find the mean number of days which elapse before you have a full set of objects.

3. Each member of a group of n players rolls a die.

(a) For any pair of players who throw the same number, the group scores | point. Find the mean and
variance of the total score of the group.

(b) Find the mean and variance of the total score if any pair of players who throw the same number
scores that number.

4, St Petersburg paradox. A fair coin is tossed repeatedly. Let T be the number of tosses until

the first head. You are offered the following prospect, which you may accept on payment of a fee. If

T =k, say, then you will receive £2". What would be a ‘fair’ fee to ask of you?

5. Let X have mass function

{x(a+D}-! ifx =1,2,...,
0 otherwise,

fay={
and let a € R. For what values of « is it the caset that E(X%) < 00?

+This problem was mentioned by Nicholas Bernoulli in 1713, and Daniel Bernoulli wrote about the question
for the Academy of St Petersburg.

If @ is not integral, than E(X%) is called the fractional moment of order a of X. A point concerning
notation: for real a and complex x = re!?, x” should be interpreted as r%e’?”, so that |x| = r®. In particular,
E(|X*|) = E(|X|®).
