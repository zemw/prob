Stationary processes

9.1 Solutions. Introduction

1. We examine sequences W,, of the form

oe)
(*) Wn = > agZn—k
k=0

for the real sequence {ax : k > 0}. Substitute, to obtain ag = 1, aj = a, ay = aa;_1| + Ba;—2,7r > 2,
with solution
(l+r)aq if a? +46 =0,
= r+l r+1
or Ay Ag

otherwise,
Ay — AQ

where 4. and Az are the (possibly complex) roots of the quadratic x? — ax — B = 0 (these roots are
distinct if and only if a2 + 48 # 0).
Using the method in the solution to Problem (8.7.2), the sum in (*) converges in mean square and

almost surely if |A;| < 1 and |A2| < 1. Assuming this holds, we have from (+) that E(W,) = 0 and
the autocovariance function is

c(m) = E(Wn Wa-m) = ac(m —1)+ Be(m—2), mol,

by the independence of the Z,. Therefore W is weakly stationary, and the autocovariance function
may be expressed in terms of a and £.

2. We adopt the convention that, if the binary expansion of U is non-unique, then we take the
(unique) non-terminating such expansion. It is clear that X; takes values in {0, 1}, and

P(Xn41 = 1|X; =x; for1 <i <n)=5
for all xj, x2,...,%n; therefore the X’s are independent Bernoulli random variables. For any se-
quence ky < ky < --- < k,, the joint distribution of Vj, , Vy,,..., Ve, depends only on that of
Xi +1> Xky 42. +++ Since this distribution is the same as the distribution of X;, X2,..., we have that
(Vk, > Vig» --+> Vk) has the same distribution as (Vo, Vi—k,,---» Vk-—k,)- Therefore V is strongly
stationary.

Clearly E(Vn) = E(Vo) = 5 and, by the independence of the X;,

oo
cov(Vo, Vn) = 5-272" var(Xi) = ay(4)".
