[13.6.2]-[13.6.5] Solutions Diffusion processes

by a consideration of the minimum value of W on (0, t]. It follows that the density function of W(4),
conditional on ZN {W(O) = w}, where w > 0, is

2. Itis a standard exercise that, for a Wiener process W,

l-s

E{W(t) |W) =a, wy =0} =a(-—),

E{W(s)?| W(0) = W(1) = 0} =s(1—s),

if0 <s <+t <1. Therefore the Brownian bridge B satisfies, forO < 5s <t <1,
1-t
E(B(s)B(t)) = E{ B(s)E(B(t) | B(s))} = FTE”) =s(1—t)

as required. Certainly E(B(s)) = 0 for all s, by symmetry.

3. W isa zero-mean Gaussian process on [0, 1] with continuous sample paths, and also W(0) =
W(1) = 0. Therefore W is a Brownian bridge if it has the same autocovariance function as the
Brownian bridge, that is, c(s, t) = min{s, t} — st. Fors < f,

cov(W(s), W(t)) = cov(W(s) — sW(1), W(t) —fW(1)) =s —ts —st4+st=s—st
since cov(W(u), W(v)) = min{u, v}. The claim follows.

4. Either calculate the instantaneous mean and variance of Ww, or repeat the argument in the solution
to Exercise (13.6.3). The only complication in this case is the necessity to show that Wit) is as.

Certainly it is true in the limit as u — oo through the integers, since, for integral u, W(u — 1) may be
expressed as the sum of u — 1 independent N (0, 1) variables (use the strong law). It remains to fill in the
gaps. Let n be a positive integer, let x > 0, and write My, = max{|W(u) —W(n)|:n<u<n+ti}.
We have by the stationarity of the increments that

5. In the notation of Exercise (13.6.4), we are asked to calculate the probability that W has no zeros
in the time interval between s/(1 — s) andt/(i — t). By Theorem (13.4.8), this equals
