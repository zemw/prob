(12.9.11]-[12.9.13] Solutions Martingales

for any event B defined in terms of {X (u) : u < s}. The derivative of this expression, with respect to
t, is (P;Gh’);, where P, is the transition semigroup, G is the generator, andh = (A(j) : j = 0). In
this case,

for all 7. Therefore the left side of (*) is constant for t > s, and is equal to its value at time s, ie.
X(s). Hence h(X(t)) defines a martingale.

(b) We apply the optional stopping theorem with T = min{t : X(t) € {0, n}} to obtain E(A(X(T))) =
E(A(X (0))), and therefore (1 — 2(m))h(n) = h(m) as required. It is necessary but not difficult to
check the conditions of the optional stopping theorem.

11. (a) Since Y is a submartingale, so is Y+ (see Exercise (12.1.6)). Now
EV mat | Fn) = ELEY mat | Fnt1) | Fn} > EM | Fn):

Therefore {E(¥g4m | Fn) : m > O} is (a.s.) non-decreasing, and therefore converges (a.s.) to a limit
M,,. Also, by monotone convergence of conditional expectation,

E(Mn+1 | Fn) = lim ELEC mgt | Fatt) | Fa} = him ECs ng1 | Fn) = Mn,

and furthermore E(Mn) = limy—oo E(Y yt in) < M. It is the case that My is F,-measurable, and
therefore it is a martingale.

(b) We have that Zn = Mn — Yp is the difference of a martingale and a submartingale, and is therefore
a supermartingale. Also M, > yt > 0, and the decomposition for Y, follows.
(c) In this case Zn is a martingale, being the difference of two martingales. Also My, > E(Y,' | Fn) =
Y," > Yn as., and the claim follows.
12. We may as well assume that ~ < P since the inequality is trivial otherwise. The moment

generating function of P — C, is M(t) = e! ? —H)+70°t" and we choose t such that M(t) = 1,
ie. t = —2(P — p)/o?. Now define Zn = min{e'™, 1} and Fy = o(C}, Co,..., Cn). Certainly
E|Zn| < co; also

E(Zn41 | Fn) SECC "+ | Fn) = ef MQ) = etl
and E(Z,41 | Fn) < 1, implying that E(Z,41 | Fn) < Zn. Therefore (Zy, Fn) is a positive
supermartingale. Let T = inf{n : Y, < 0} = inf{n : Z, = 1}. Then T A m is a bounded stopping
time, whence E(Zg) > E(Zram) = P(T < m). Letm — oo to obtain the result.
13. Let F, =o (R1, Ro,..., Rn).
(a) 0 < Y, < 1, and Y, is ¥,-measurable. Also

Rn

K(X, Rn) = R, _—-—;
(Rn+1 | n) n+ oad

whence Yy satisfies E(¥;+41 | Fn) = Yn. Therefore {Y, : n > 0} is a uniformly integrable martingale,
and therefore converges a.s. and in mean.

(b) In order to apply the optional stopping theorem, it suffices that P(T < oo) = 1 (since Y is
uniformly integrable). However P(T > n) = 4 . s vee aH =(nt1)7! +0. Using that theorem,
E(Y’r) = E(¥o), which is to say that E{7/(T + 2)} = 3, and the result follows.

(c) Apply the maximal inequality.
