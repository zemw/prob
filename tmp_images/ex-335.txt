(7.2.8]-[7.3.1] Solutions Convergence of random variables

(d) A neat way is to use the Skorokhod representation (7.2.14). If Xn ae X, find random variables

Yn, Y with the same distributions such that Y, “Ss y. Then cnYn “3 cy , so that cn Yn », cy,
implying the same conclusion for the X’s.

8. If X is nota.s. constant, there exist real numbers c and € such that 0 < € < 5 and P(X < c) > 2e,

P(X >c+e) > 2e. Since Xy LA X, there exists N such that
P(Xn <c)>e, P(X, >c+O>e, ifneN.

Also, by the triangle inequality, |X, — Xs| < |X; — X| + |Xs — X|; therefore there exists M such
that P(|X r— Xs| > €) < €? for r,s > M. Assume now that the X, are independent. Then, for
r,s >max{M,N},r 4s,

e > P([X; — Xs| > €) => P(X, <c, Xs >c+€) = P(X; < 0)P(Xs > +0) > 2,

a contradiction.

9. Either use the fact (Exercise (4.12.3)) that convergence in total variation implies convergence in
distribution, together with Theorem (7.2.19), or argue directly thus. Since |u(-)| < K < o%,

|E@u(Xn)) — E(u(X))| = So wef - fe <K > \fs® — f®|> 0.

10. The partial sum Sy, = >7}_.; Xr is Poisson-distributed with parameter on = 7), Ar. For fixed
x, the event {S, < x} is decreasing in n, whence by Lemma (1.3.5), if o, ~ o < co and x isa
non-negative integer,

x

[o@) . e%q/
P(x <x) = jim P(Sn <x) => jy
r= y=

Hence if o < 00, aay X,y converges to a Poisson random variable. On the other hand, if o, — oo,
then e~ yj =0 of /j! — 0, giving that Pope Xy > x) = 1 for all x, and therefore the sum
diverges with probability 1, as required.

7.3 Solutions. Some ancillary results
1. (a If |Xn — Xm| > € then either |X, — X| > iG or |Xm — X| > 56, so that
P(|Xn — Xml > €) < P(|Xn —X| > 3€) +P(|\Xm — X|> ze) 30

Conversely, suppose that {X,} is Cauchy convergent in probability. For each positive integer k,
there exists ny, such that

P(IXn—Xml>=27-*) <2* — forn,m > ng.

The sequence (nx) may not be increasing, and we work instead with the sequence defined by Nj = 71,
Ne+1 = max{Nz + 1, ng41}. We have that

So P(X Nes —Xnjl2 2-*) < 00,
