Figure 3.1. The network with source s and sink t.

For the reliability, see Problem (1.8.19a).
6. The structure function is I;s>j;;, the indicator function of {S > k} where S = "=| Xc. The
reliability is therefore )7?_, (7) p'(1 — p)??.

7. Independently colour each vertex livid or bronze with probability 5 each, and let L be the random

set of livid vertices. Then EN; = 51E |. There must exist one or more possible values of Nz, which
are at least as large as its mean.

8. Let J, be the indicator function that the rth pair have opposite polarity, so that X = 1+ yr} I.
We have that P(J; = 1) = 5 and PUI, = I,41 = 1) = 4, whence EX = $(n + 1) and var X =
4 — 1).

9. (a) Let A; be the event that the integer i remains in the ith position. Then

P(U ar) = Pan) = PrN As) ++ DP) Ar)

Therefore the number M of matches satisfies

P(M =0)= tI.

Now

P(M=r)= (") P(r given numbers match, and the remaining n — r are deranged)
