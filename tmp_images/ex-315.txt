[6.15.9]-[6.15.9] Solutions Markov chains

where f; is the probability that the first return of X to its persistent starting point s takes place at time
i. Certainly ug = 1.

Conversely, suppose u is a renewal sequence with respect to the collection (fi, : m > 1). Let X
be a Markov chain on the state space § = {0, 1, 2, ...} with transition matrix

jo {Pozitaipeled if j =i +1,

where T is a random variable having mass function fy, = P(T = m). With Xo = 0, the chance that
the first return to O takes place at time n is

whence vy = uy, for all n.

(b) Let X and Y be the two Markov chains which are associated (respectively) with u and v in the
above sense. We shall assume that X and Y are independent. The product (u;vp : n > 1) is now the
renewal sequence associated with the bivariate Markov chain (Xn, Yn).

9. Of the first 2n steps, let there be i rightwards, 7 upwards, and k inwards. Now X2, = 0 if
and only if there are also i leftwards, 7 downwards, and k outwards. The number of such possible
combinations is (2n)!/{(i! j! k!)*}, and each such combination has probability (2)?¢+/+) = (4)2”.
The first equality follows, and the second is immediate.

It is not difficult to see that the maximum M is attained when i, j, and k are all closest to 5n, so that

Furthermore the summation in () equals 1, since the summand is the probability that, in allocating n
balls randomly to three urns, the urns contain respectively i, j, and k balls. It follows that
