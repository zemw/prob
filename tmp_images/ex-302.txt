7. Let Ty be the time of the nth arrival, and let T = limp oo Tr = sup{t : N(t) < oo}. Now, as in
Exercise (6.8.6),

dnPn(O) = |] —— =Ee@-o™
nPn(?) es orerw, (e-""")

since Ty = Xp +X1+---+Xn where Xx is the (k + 1)th interarrival time, a random variable which is
exponentially distributed with parameter A,. Using the continuity theorem, E(e—?7) —> E(e7®") as
n —> 00, whence An Pn(O) > E(e—°T) as n —> 00, which may be inverted to obtain An pn(t) > f (1)
as n —> co where / is the density function of T. Now

E(N(t) | N(t) < 00) = Yon Pn(t)

which converges or diverges according to whether or not >, apn(t) converges. However pn(t) ~
aw FO as n —> 00, so that 5°, npn(t) < oo if and only if >, naz} < oO.
When Ay = (n+ 5°, we have that

Inverting the Laplace transform (or consulting a table of such transforms) we find that

1. (a) We have that

Pip =P +API2, Poo = —Ap22 + uP2I,

where p12 = 1 — py, P21 = 1 — p22. Solve these subject to p;;(t) = 4;;, the Kronecker delta, to
obtain that the matrix P; = (pj; (t)) is given by
