where #A denotes the cardinality of the set A. By rearrangement, d,4 1 —(n+1)dn = —(dn—ndy_}).

3.5 Solutions. Examples of discrete variables

1. There are n!/(n,!n!---n;!) sequences of outcomes in which the ith possible outcome occurs
n; times for each i. The probability of any such sequence is p;! p,? --- p;*, and the result follows.

2. The total number H of heads satisfies

x! oat (n—x)!

The last summation equals 1, since it is the sum of the values of the Poisson mass function with
parameter A(1 — p).

3. dpn/dd = Pp—1 — Pn Where p_, = 0. Hence (d/dd)P(X <n) = pp(A).

4. The probability of a marked animal in the nth place is a/b. Conditional on this event, the chance
of n — 1 preceding places containing m — 1 marked and n — m unmarked animals is

(521) (028) /Cc))

as required. Now let X; be the number of unmarked animals between the j — 1th and jth marked
animals, if all were caught. By symmetry, EX; = (6 — a)/(a + 1), whence EX = m(EX; +1) =
m(b + 1)/(a4+ 1).

3.6 Solutions. Dependence

1. Remembering Problem (2.7.3b), it suffices to show that var(aX + bY) < o if a,b € R and
var(X), var(Y) < oo. Now,

var(aX + bY) = E({aX + bY - B(aX +bY)}’)
= a” var(X) + 2ab cov(X, Y) + b* var(Y)
< a’ var(X) + 2ab/var(X) var(Y) + b” var(Y)
2
= (ay/var(X) + by/var(¥))

where we have used the Cauchy—Schwarz inequality (3.6.9) applied to X — E(X), Y — E(Y).

2. Let N; be the number of times the ith outcome occurs. Then Nj; has the binomial distribution
with parameters n and p;.
