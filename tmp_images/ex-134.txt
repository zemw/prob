Problems Exercises [12.9.20]-[12.9.24]

week. Explain why a sensible strategy for the businessman is to sell in the week T, where T is a
stopping time chosen so as to maximize

Tr
wT) = e{( +a)? Xr-S + are

n=1

Show that this problem is equivalent to maximizing E{(1 + a)~7 Zr} where Zy = Xy +c/a.
Show that there exists a unique positive real number y with the property that

CO
ay -| P(Zyn > y) dy,
Y

and that, for this value of y, the sequence V, = (1+a@)~” max{Z,, y} constitutes a supermartingale.
Deduce that the optimal strategy for the businessman is to set a target price t (which you should
specify in terms of y) and sell the first time he is offered at least this price.

In the case when f (x) = 2x73 forx > 1,andc =a = ay find his target price and the expected
number of weeks he will have to wait before selling.
20. Let Z be a branching process satisfying Zp = 1, E(Z,) < 1, and P(Z, > 2) > 0. Show that
E(sup,, Zn) < n/(n— 1), where n is the largest root of the equation x = G(x) and G is the probability
generating function of Z.
21. Matching. In a cloakroom there are K coats belonging to K people who make an attempt to
leave by picking a coat at random. Those who pick their own coat leave, the rest return the coats and

try again at random. Let N be the number of rounds of attempts until everyone has left. Show that
EN = K and var(N) < K.

22. Let W be a standard Wiener process, and define
t
M(t) = [ W(u) du — 4 wa)?
0

Show that M(t) is a martingale, and deduce that the expected area under the path of W until it first
reaches one of the levels a (> 0) or b (< 0) is —zab(a +b).

23. Let W = (W), Wo,..., Wa) be a d-dimensional Wiener process, the W; being independent
one-dimensional Wiener processes with W;(0) = 0 and variance parameter o2 =d7!. Let Rity* =
Wi (t)? + W(t)? So Wa(t)?, and show that R(t)? — tis a martingale. Deduce that the mean
time to hit the sphere of R@ with radius a is a”.

24. Let W be a standard one-dimensional Wiener process, and let a,b > 0. Let T be the earliest

time at which W visits either of the two points —a, b. Show that P(W(T) = b) = a/(a + b) and
E(T) = ab. In the case a = b, find E(e~*T) for s > 0.
