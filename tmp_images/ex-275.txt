[5.12.34]-[5.12.36] Solutions Generating functions and their applications

(c) Let Z, be Poisson with parameter n. By part (a),

where ® is the N(O, 1) distribution function. The left hand side equals P(Zn <n) = "fo eink /Kt.

34. If you are in possession of r — 1 different types, the waiting time for the acquisition of the next
new type is geometric with probability generating function

Therefore the characteristic function of Uy, = (T, — nlogn)/n is

The denominator satisfies

as n —> 00, by expanding the exponential function, and hence

where we have used Euler’s product for the gamma function:

Tro +r)

the convergence being uniform on any region of the complex plane containing no singularity of T.
The claim now follows by the result of Problem (5.12.27c).

It follows that, as n —> 00, dy (t) —> dp;, the Kronecker delta. The limit function is discontinuous at
t = 0 and is therefore not itself a characteristic function.

36. Let G;(s) be the probability generating function of the number shown by the ith die, and suppose
