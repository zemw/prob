are independent standard normal random variables.

8. Let U be uniform on [0, 1] and 0 < g < 1. Show that X = 1 4 [log U/log q| has a geometric
distribution.

9. A point (X, Y) is picked uniformly at random in the semicircle xe y2 <1, x > 0. What is the
distribution of Z = Y/X?

10. Hazard-rate technique. Let X be a non-negative integer-valued random variable with h(r) =
P(X =r|X =r). If {U; : i = 0} are independent and uniform on [0, 1], show that Z = min{n :
Un < h(n)} has the same distribution as X.

li. Antithetic variables. Let g(x, x2,..., ,) be an increasing function in all its variables, and
let {U; : r > 1} be independent and identically distributed random variables having the uniform
distribution on [0, 1]. Show that

cov{g(U;, U2, ...,Un), 8 — Uj, 1— U2, ...,1—Un)} <0.
[Hint: Use the FKG inequality of Problem (3.10.18).] Explain how this can help in the efficient
estimation of J = fo g(x) dx.

12. Importance sampling. We wish to estimate J = [ g(x) fx(x) dx = E(g(X)), where either it
is difficult to sample from the density fy, or g(X) has a very large variance. Let fy be equivalent
to fy, which is to say that, for all x, fy(x) = 0 if and only if fy(~) = 0. Let {Y¥; :0 <i <n}be
independent random variables with density function fy, and define

The idea here is that fy should be easy to sample from, and chosen if possible so that var J is
much smaller than n—[E(g (X )?) -—T 21, The function fy is called the importance density.

1. Show that X is stochastically larger than Y if and only if E(@(X)) > E(u(Y)) for any non-
decreasing function u for which the expectations exist.

2. Let X and Y be Poisson distributed with respective parameters A and yz. Show that X is stochas-
tically larger than Y if A > yp.

3. Show that the total variation distance between two discrete variables X, Y satisfies

dry(X, Y) = 2 sup |P(X € A) — PY € A)|.
