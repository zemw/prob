(a) Show that F,, is indeed a distribution function, and that X,, has a density function.
(b) Show that, as n — oo, F, converges to the uniform distribution function, but that the density
function of F, does not converge to the uniform density function.

3. Accoin is tossed repeatedly, with heads turning up with probability p on each toss. Let N be the
minimum number of tosses required to obtain & heads. Show that, as p | 0, the distribution function
of 2Np converges to that of a gamma distribution.

4, If X is an integer-valued random variable with characteristic function ¢, show that
1 fF .;
P(X =k = = | ek gr) dt.
2n J—x

What is the corresponding result for a random variable whose distribution is arithmetic with span
(that is, there is probability one that X is a multiple of A, and A is the largest positive number with this
property)?

5. Use the inversion theorem to show that

6. Stirling’s formula. Let f,(~) be a differentiable function on R with a a global maximum at

a > 0, and such that Sor exp{ fn(x)}dx < oo. Laplace’s method of steepest descent (related to
Watson’s lemma and saddlepoint methods) asserts under mild conditions that

[ exp{ fn(x)} dx ~ i exp{ fn(@) + d(x - a)? f7'(a)} dx asn>o.

By setting f,(x) = nlogx — x, prove Stirling’s formula: n! ~ n"e"" JV 2700.

7. Let X = (X1, X2,...,Xn) have the multivariate normal distribution with zero means, and
covariance matrix V = (v;;) satisfying |V| > 0 and vj; > 0 for all i, 7. Show that
