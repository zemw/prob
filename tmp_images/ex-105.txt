1 t
(a) Show that “ff Tix(s)=j} as ass ast > &;
0

(b) deduce that the stationary distribution w satisfies 7; = 1/(u; gj);
(c) show that, if f is a bounded function on S,

-[ f(X(s)) ds =4s Ease as t > 00.

34. Tail equivalence. Suppose that the sequences {X, :n > 1} and {Y, : n > 1} are tail equivalent,
which is to say that )>7°., P(Xn # Yn) < 00. Show that:

(a) S372, Xn and S>7°., Yn converge or diverge together,
(b) any (Xn — Yn) converges almost surely,

(c) if there exist a random variable X and a sequence a, such that a, t oo and a,, 1 ae Xy 3S. Xx ;

35. Three series theorem. Let {X, : 2 > 1} be independent random variables. Show that eat Xn
converges a.s. if, for some a > 0, the following three series all converge:

(a) So, PUXal > @),

(b) Sy var(Xnlx_|<a})

(C) oy, E(Xnl x, |<a})-

[The converse holds also, but is harder to prove.]

36. Let {Xp :n > 1} be independent random variables with continuous common distribution function

F. We call X, a record value for the sequence if X, > X; for 1 <r < k, and we write J; for the
indicator function of the event that X; is a record value.

(a) Show that the random variables J; are independent.
(b) Show that Rm = > 71 Ir satisfies Rm /logm “5; Lasm > 00.

37. Random harmonic series. Let {X;, : 2 > 1} be a sequence of independent random variables
with P(X, = 1) = P(X, = -1) = 4 Does the series }°”_, X;/r converge a.s. asm > 00?
