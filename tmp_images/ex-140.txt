that the ratio r(¢) = u(t)/v(t) is continuous and strictly increasing with inverse function r—!, Show
that W(t) = X(r7!(a)) / v(r—1(t)) is a standard Wiener process on a suitable interval of time.
If c(s,t) =s(. —t) fors <+t < 1, express X in terms of W.

3. Let B > 0, and show that U(t) = e—F! w(e2t — 1) is an Ornstein—-Uhlenbeck process if W is a
standard Wiener process.

4. Let V = {V(t) : t > 0} be an Ornstein—Uhlenbeck process with instantaneous mean a(t, x) =
— Bx where B > 0, with instantaneous variance b(t, x) = o”, and with U (0) = u. Show that V(£) is
N(ue~P#, o2(1 — e~ Ft) /(2B)). Deduce that V(t) is asymptotically N(0, 507/B) as t —> oo, and
show that V is strongly stationary if V (0) is N(O, 5a? /B).

Show that such a process is the only stationary Gaussian Markov process with continuous auto-
covariance function, and find its spectral density function.

5. Let D = {D(t) : t > 0} be a diffusion process with instantaneous mean a(t, x) = ax and
instantaneous variance b(f, x) = Bx where a and 6 are positive constants. Let D(O) = d. Show that
the moment generating function of D(t) is

6. Let D be an Ornstein—Uhlenbeck process with D(0) = 0, and place reflecting barriers at —c and

8. Let W bea standard Wiener process with W (0) = 0. Place absorbing barriers at —b and b, where

Hence calculate P(supp<; <, |W(s)| > 5) for the unrestricted process W.

9. Let D bea Wiener process with drift m, and suppose that D(0) = 0. Place absorbing barriers at
the points x = —a and x = b where a and b are positive real numbers. Show that the probability pg
