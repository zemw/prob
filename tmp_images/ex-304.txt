Continuous-time Markov chains Solutions [6.9.5]-[6.9.8]

by conditioning on the (n + 1)th interarrival time of N; here, as usual, pj; (¢) is a transition probability
of X. Now

5. The jump chain Z = {Z, : n > O} has transition probabilities hj; = g;;/g;, i # j. The chance
that Z ever reaches A from j is also nj, and nj = Me hjxnx for j ¢ A, by Exercise (6.3.6). Hence
—8jnj = don Bk Nk, as required.

6. Let 7; = inf{t : X(t) 4 X(O)}, and more generally let Tj, be the time of the mth change in value
of X. For j ¢ A,

Mj =Ej(T1) + D> hjewe,
kj

where Ej denotes expectation conditional on Xp = j. Now Ej (71) = 8 vy, and the given equations
follow. Suppose next that (a, : k € S) is another non-negative solution of these equations. With
U; = Tj41 — T; and R = min{n > 1: Zn € A}, we have for j ¢ A that

as n —> 00, by monotone convergence. Therefore, yz is the minimal non-negative solution.

7. First note that i is persistent if and only if it is also a persistent state in the jump chain Z. The
integrand being positive, we can write

where {Tn : n > 1} are the times of the jumps of X. The right side equals

where H = (h;;) is the transition matrix of Z. The sum diverges if and only if i is persistent for Z.

8. Since the imbedded jump walk is persistent, so is X. The probability of visiting m during an
excursion is @ = (2m)~!, since such a visit requires an initial step to the right, followed by a visit to
m before 0, cf. Example (3.9.6). Having arrived at m, the chance of returning to m before visiting 0
is 1 — a, by the same argument with 0 and m interchanged. In this way one sees that the number NV
of visits to m during an excursion from 0 has distribution given by P(N > k) = a(1 — aj] k>1.
The ‘total jump rate’ from any state is A, whence T may be expressed as an V; where the V; are
exponential with parameter A. Therefore,
