20. Successive offers for my house are independent identically distributed random variables X1,
X7,..., having density function f and distribution function F. Let Yj; = X1, let Y be the first offer
exceeding Y,, and generally let Y,, 41 be the first offer exceeding Y, . Show that Y,, Y2,... are the times
of arrivals in a non-homogeneous Poisson process with intensity function A(t) = f(t)/C — F(a).
The Y; are called ‘record values’.

Now let Z, be the first offer received which is the second largest to date, and let Zz be the second
such offer, and so on. Show that the Z; are the arrival times of a non-homogeneous Poisson process
with intensity function A.

21. Let N be a Poisson process with constant intensity A, and let Y;, Y2,... be independent random
variables with common characteristic function ¢ and density function f. The process N*(t) =
Y, + Y2 +--++ Yq) is called a compound Poisson process. Yp, is the change in the value of N* at
the nth arrival of the Poisson process N. Think of it like this. A ‘random alarm clock’ rings at the
arrival times of a Poisson process. At the nth ring the process N* accumulates an extra quantity Y).
Write down a forward equation for N* and hence find the characteristic function of N*(t). Can you
see directly why it has the form which you have found?

22. If the intensity function 2 of a non-homogeneous Poisson process N is itself a random process,
then N is called a doubly stochastic Poisson process (or Cox process). Consider the case when
A(t) = A for all t, and A is arandom variable taking either of two values A, or Az, each being picked

with equal probability 5. Find the probability generating function of N(t), and deduce its mean and
variance.

23. Show that a simple birth process X with parameter 4 is a doubly stochastic Poisson process with
intensity function A(t) = AX(#).

24. The Markov chain X = {X(t) : t > 0} is a birth process whose intensities A; (t) depend also on
the time t and are given by

Hence find the mean and variance of X (+) when X (0) = I.

25. (a) Let X be a birth—-death process with strictly positive birth rates 49, A ,,... and death rates

that

(b) For the discrete-time chain on the non-negative integers with
