(b) if Y, is geometric with parameter p = )/n then the distribution of Y, /n converges to an expo-
nential distribution.

The following steps may be useful. Let oF = var(X;), a(n) = var(Sy), 07 = E|X}|, and $j
and Wm be the characteristic functions of X; and Sp /o(n) respectively.
) Use Taylor’s theorem to show that |g; (t) — 1] < 28? and |pj(t) — 1 + 507271 < ep; for
j21.

Gi) Show that | log(1 + z) — z| < Iz|? if |z| < i, where the logarithm has its principal value.

(iii) Show that o3 < p;, and deduce from the hypothesis that max1<j<,0;/0(n) > Oasn — oo,
implying that max) <;<» |b; (¢/o(#)) — 1| > 0.

(iv) Deduce an upper bound for |log o;(t/o(n))— 500? /o (ny | , and sum to obtain that log y(t) >

42. Normal sample. Let X1, X2,..., Xn be independent N(u, a) random variables. Define X =
n—! 5“? X; and Z; = X; — X. Find the joint characteristic function of X, Z,, Zz, ..., Zn, and hence
prove that X and S 2 (n— y7! I (Xj -— X)* are independent.

43. Log-normal distribution. Let X be N(0, 1), and let Y = e*: Y is said to have the log-normal
distribution. Show that the density function of Y is

f@ = exp{—4(logx)}, x>0.

For |a| < 1, define fa(x) = {1 +a sin(2z log x)} F(x). Show that fo is adensity function with finite
moments of all (positive) orders, none of which depends on the value of a. The family { fa : |a| < 1}
contains density functions which are not specified by their moments.

44. Consider a random walk whose steps are independent and identically distributed integer-valued
random variables with non-zero mean. Prove that the walk is transient.

45. Recurrent events. Let {X; : r > 1} be the integer-valued identically distributed intervals
between the times of a recurrent event process. Let L be the earliest time by which there has been an
interval of length a containing no occurrence time. Show that, for integral a,

46. A biased coin shows heads with probability p (= 1 — q). It is flipped repeatedly until the first
time W, by which it has shown n consecutive heads. Let E(s Wn) = Gy(s). Show that Gy =
