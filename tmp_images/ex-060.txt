Branching processes Exercises [5.3.7]-[5.4.6]

7. Let Sp = Soreo Xr be a left-continuous random walk on the integers with a retaining barrier
at zero. More specifically, we assume that the X; are identically distributed integer-valued random
variables with X; > —1, P(X; = 0) 4 0, and
Sn t+ Xn41 if Sy > 0,
Sn4l = :

Show that the distribution of Sg may be chosen in such a way that E(z5") = E(z50) for all n, if and
only if E(X,) < 0, and in this case
(1 — )E(X)EG*!)

1 — E(z*1)

E(z%*) =

8. Consider a simple random walk starting at 0 in which each step is to the right with probability
p (= 1-4). Let Ty be the number of steps until the walk first reaches b where b > 0. Show that
E(Tp | Th < 00) = b/|p — ql.

1. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation in an ordinary branching process with Zg = 1, E(Z1) = pu,
and var(Z,) > 0. Show that E(Z,Zm) = u—"R(Z2) for m <n. Hence find the correlation
coefficient o(Zm, Zn) in terms of 2.

2. Consider a branching process with generation sizes Zy, satisfying Zo = 1 and P(Z, = 0) = 0.
Pick two individuals at random (with replacement) from the nth generation and let L be the index of
the generation which contains their most recent common ancestor. Show that P(L = r) = E(Z, 1y _

E(Z,,1) for 0 <r <n. What can be said if P(Z, = 0) > 0?

3. Consider a branching process whose family sizes have the geometric mass function f(k) = gp*,
k > 0, where p + q = 1, and let Zp be the size of the nth generation. Let T = min{n : Zp = 0} be
the extinction time, and suppose that Zg = 1. Find P(T = n). For what values of p is it the case that
E(T) < ~?

4. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation of a branching process, and assume Zp = 1. Find an

expression for the generating function Gy of Z,, in the cases when Z, has generating function given

by:

(a) G(s) =1-—a(1—s)?, 0<a,B <1.

(b) Gs) = f —ltp( f (s))}, where P is a probability generating function, and f is a suitable function
satisfying f(1) = 1.

(c) Suppose in the latter case that f(x) = x” and P(s) = s{y-—(v- 1s}7! where y > 1. Calculate
the answer explicitly.

5. Branching with immigration. Each generation of a branching process (with a single progenitor)
is augmented by a random number of immigrants who are indistinguishable from the other members
of the population. Suppose that the numbers of immigrants in different generations are independent
of each other and of the past history of the branching process, each such number having probability
generating function H(s). Show that the probability generating function G, of the size of the nth
generation satisfies G,i1(s) = Gn(G(s))A(s), where G is the probability generating function of a
typical family of offspring.

6. Let Z, be the size of the nth generation in a branching process with E(s41) = (2—s)7!
and Zp = 1. Let V, be the total number of generations of size r. Show that E(V|) = in?, and
E(2V2 — V3) = ¢2? — gy’.
