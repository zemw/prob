[7.3.13}-[7.4.3] Solutions Convergence of random variables

13. We divide the numerator and denominator by ./no. By the central limit theorem, the former
converges in distribution to the N(0, 1) distribution. We expand the new denominator, squared, as

By the weak law of large numbers (Theorem (5.10.2), combined with Theorem (7.2.3)), the first term
converges in probability to 1, and the other terms to 0. Their sum converges to 1, by Theorem (7.3.9),
and the result follows by Slutsky’s theorem, Exercise (7.2.5).

1. Let Sp, =X, +X2+---+ Xn. Then

n . 2
E(S2) = 4° — <

and therefore S,/n 5, 0. On the other hand, >>; P(|X;| = i) = 1, so that |X;| > i i.o., with
probability one, by the second Borel—Cantelli lemma. For such a value of i, we have that |$; — $;~1| >
i, implying that S,/n does not converge, with probability one.

2. Let the Xy satisfy

P(Xn = —-n)=1-—5, P(X, =n “n=:

whence they have zero mean. However,

implying by the first Borel—-Cantelli lemma that P(X,/n — —1) = 1. It is an elementary result of
real analysis that no! ed Xn — —lif x, — —1, and the claim follows.

3. The random variable N(S) has mean and variance 4|S| = cr?, where c is a constant depending
only on d. By Chebyshov’s inequality,

S| ~ ) ~ eS) Ve) crt

By the first Borel—Cantelli lemma,

where S; is the sphere of radius k. It follows that N(S;)/|Sx| =, ask —> oo. The same conclusion
holds as k — oo through the reals, since N(S) is non-decreasing in the radius of S.
