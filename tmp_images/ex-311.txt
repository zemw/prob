elementary coordinate geometry, the intensity function in plane polar coordinates is 24/11 — r?,
O<r<1,0<0 <2z.

4, The same argument is valid with resulting intensity function 24./1 — r2.

5. The Mercator projection represents the spherical coordinates (@, 6) as Cartesian coordinates in
the range 0 < @ < 27, 0 < 0 <7. (Recall that 0 is the angle made with the axis through the north
pole.) Therefore a uniform intensity on the globe corresponds to an intensity function 1 sin @ on the
map. Likewise, a uniform intensity on the map corresponds to an intensity 4./ sin 6 on the globe.

6. Let the X; have characteristic function @. Conditional on the value of N(¢), the corresponding
arrival times have the same distribution as N(t) independent variables with the uniform distribution,
whence

Differentiate with respect to x and y to obtain the joint density function A(x)A(x + y)e7A@),
x, y > 0. Since this does not generally factorize as the product of a function of x and a function of y,
T, and T> are dependent in general.
