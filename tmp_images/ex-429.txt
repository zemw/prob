1. Let H beaclosed sphere with radius R (> |w|), and define pr(r) = P(G before H ||W(0)| =r).
Then pp satisfies Laplace’s equation in IR¢, and hence

d

since pr is spherically symmetric. Solve subject to the boundary equations pr(¢) = 1, pr(R) = 0,

to obtain

as R > oo.

2. The electrical resistance R, between 0 and the set A, is no smaller than the resistance obtained
by, for every i = 1,2,..., ‘shorting out’ all vertices in the set A;. This new network amounts to a
linear chain of resistances in series, points labelled Aj and Aj, being joined by a resistance if size

N;"!. It follows that

RG) = lim, Rn 2 » Ni

By Theorem (13.11.18), the walk is persistent if 57; Ny} = 00.

3. Thinking of G as an electrical network, one may obtain the network H by replacing the resistance
of every edge e lying in G but not in H by oo. Let 0 be a vertex of H. By a well known fact in the
theory of electrical networks, R(H) > R(G), and the result follows by Theorem (13.11.19).

13.12 Solutions to problems

1 (@Ta)=aWe/ a2) has continuous sample paths with stationary independent increments, since
W has these properties. Also T (t)/a is N(0, t/a”), whence T(t) is N(0, t).

(b) As for part (a).

(c) Certainly V has continuous sample paths on (0, oo). For continuity at 0 it suffices to prove that
twa) — Oas. ast | 0; this was done in the solution to Exercise (13.6.4).

If (u,v), (s,f) are disjoint time-intervals, then so are (ol, uy, a}, sh; since W has
independent increments, so has V. Finally,

Vis +2) — V(s) =tW((s +2)7!) — s{ Ws!) — Ws + 1)7})}

2. Certainly W is Gaussian with continuous sample paths and zero means, and itis therefore sufficient
to prove that cov(W(s), W(t)) = min{s, t}. Now, ifs < t,

_ cov(Xr7'(s)), X71) — ue TO)
cov(W(s), WO) = Tee) ve) TO OS
