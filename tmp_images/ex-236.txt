56. We use an argument similar to that used for Buffon’s needle. Dropping the paper at random
amounts to dropping the lattice at random on the paper. The mean number of points of the lattice in a
small element of area dA is dA. By the additivity of expectations, the mean number of points on the
paper is A. There must therefore exist a position for the paper in which it covers at least [A] points.

57. Consider a small element of surface dS. Positioning the rock at random amounts to shining light
at this element from a randomly chosen direction. On averaging over all possible directions, we see
that the mean area of the shadow cast by dS is proportional to the area of dS. We now integrate over
the surface of the rock, and use the additivity of expectation, to deduce that the area A of the random
shadow satisfies E(A) = cS for some constant c which is independent of the shape of the rock. By
considering the special case of the sphere, we find c = i It follows that at least one orientation of

the rock gives a shadow of area at least iS.
58. (a) We have from Problem (4.14.11b) that Y¥, = X;,/(X1 +---+ X,) is independent of X; +

----+X,, and therefore of the variables X;41, X-42,°-+ ,Xk41,X1 +--+: + Xx41. Therefore Y, is
independent of {¥;45 : s => 1}, and the claim follows.
(b) Let S = X, +--+ + Xg41. The inverse transformation x1 = z15, x2 = 7225, ..., Xk = ZS,

The joint density function of X;, X2,..., Xx, S is therefore (with o = yet Br),

where /f is a function of the given variables. The result follows by integrating over s.

59. Let C = (crs) be an orthogonal » x n matrix with c,; = 1/./n for 1 <i <n. Let Y;, =

normal. Clearly EY;, = 0, and
