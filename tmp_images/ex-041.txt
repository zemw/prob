6. Three points A, B, C are chosen independently at random on the circumference of a circle. Let
b(x) be the probability that at least one of the angles of the triangle ABC exceeds x. Show that

Hence find the density and expectation of the largest angle in the triangle.

7. Let {X,: 1 <r <n} be independent and identically distributed with finite variance, and define
X =n! 57"_, X,. Show that cov(X, X, — X) =0.

8. Let X and Y be independent random variables with finite variances, and let U = X + Y and
V = XY. Under what condition are U and V uncorrelated?

9. Let X and Y be independent continuous random variables, and let U be independent of X and Y
taking the values +1 with probability 7. Define S = UX and T = UY. Show that S and 7 are in
general dependent, but S? and T? are independent.

4.6 Exercises. Conditional distributions and conditional expectation

1. A point is picked uniformly at random on the surface of a unit sphere. Writing © and ® for its
longitude and latitude, find the conditional density functions of © given ®, and of ® given ©.

2. Show that the conditional expectation w(X) = E(Y | X) satisfies E(W(X)g(X)) = E(Vg(X)),
for any function g for which both expectations exist.

3. Construct an example of two random variables X and Y for which E(Y) = oo but such that
E(Y | X) < oo almost surely.

4. Find the conditional density function and expectation of Y given X when they have joint density
function:

(a) fa y= 42e7*Y for 0 <x<y<o,
(b) f(x,y) = xe*OF for x, y > 0.

5. Let Y be distributed as bin(n, X), where X is a random variable having a beta distribution on
[O, 1] with parameters a and b. Describe the distribution of Y, and find its mean and variance. What
is the distribution of Y in the special case when X is uniform?

6. Let {X, :r > 1} be independent and uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Let 0 < x < 1 and define
N =min{n >1:X,+X2+-+-+ Xp > x}.
