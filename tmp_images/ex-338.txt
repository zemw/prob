Some ancillary results Solutions  [7.3.9]-[7.3.12]

Now n=! 3%" X; ae LL, by the law of large numbers (5.10.2); hence n—! 57” X; a jt (use Theorem

(7.2.4a)). It follows that (n7} Hi X;)* 4 2; to see this, either argue directly or use Problem
(7.11.3). Now use Exercise (7.2.7) to find that

Arguing similarly,
1 n 2 P
oe X? 0,
n(n — 1) 2d i”
and the result follows by the fact (Theorem (7.3.9)) that the sum of these two expressions converges
in probability to the sum of their limits.

9. Evidently,

Xn 1

By the Borel-Cantelli lemmas, the events An = {X,/logn > 1 + €} occur as. infinitely often for
—1 <e <0, and as. only finitely often for « > 0.

10. (a) Mills’s ratio (Exercise (4.4.8) or Problem (4.14.1c)) informs us that 1 — d(x) ~ x! b(x) as
x — oo. Therefore,

P(|Xn| = V/2logn(1 +€)) ~

1
Jin logn(l + e)n(ite)? |

The sum over n of these terms converges if and only if « > 0, and the Borel—-Cantelli lemmas imply
the claim.

(b) This is an easy implication of the Borel—Cantelli lemmas.

11. Let X be uniformly distributed on the interval [—1, 1], and define X_ = Ipy<(_1)n /ny- The dis-
tribution of X, approaches the Bernoulli distribution which takes the values +1 with equal probability
3 The median of X, is 1 ifm is even and —1 if n is odd.

12. (i) We have that

for x > 0. The result follows by the second Borel—Cantelli lemma.
(ii) (a) The stationary distribution z is found in the usual way to satisfy

Hence my = {k(k + 1)}7! for k > 1, a distribution with mean J°%.,(k + 1)7! = 00.
(b) By construction, P(Xn < Xo +n) = 1 for all n, whence

It may in fact be shown that P(lim supy_, 99 Xn/n = 0) = 1.
