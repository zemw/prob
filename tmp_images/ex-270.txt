Problems Solutions [5.12.20]-[5.12.22]

in the notation of Problem (5.12.18). Hence U has the Cauchy distribution.

(b) Similarly

for t > 0. Using the result of Problem (5.12.18e), V has density function

(c) We have that W~2 = X~2 4 y~2 + Z~2. Therefore, using (b),
E(etW) =e 3V2t = eV 18 = Bie 9)

for t > 0. It follows that W~? has the same distribution as 9V = 9X~2, and so W” has the same
distribution as aX 2 Therefore, using the fact that both X and W are symmetric random variables, W

has the same distribution as 3 X, that is N(0, §).

20. It follows from the inversion theorem that

Since |@| is integrable, we may use the dominated convergence theorem to take the limit ash | 0
within the integral:

fe ~ Om N->00 _N- ¢ ‘

The condition that ¢ be absolutely integrable is stronger than necessary; note that the characteristic
function of the exponential distribution fails this condition, in reflection of the fact that its density
function has a discontinuity at the origin.

21. Let G, denote the probability generating function of Z,. The (conditional) characteristic function
of Z,/p" is

It is a standard exercise (or see Example (5.4.3)) that
