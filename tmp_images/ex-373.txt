The integrand is dominated by the integrable function 2|o(t)|. Using the dominated convergence
theorem, we deduce that | f(x +) — f(x)| > 0as h — 0, uniformly in x.

9. By Exercise (9.5.2), var(n—! jal Xj) > o? if Ch = nv! ar, cov(X9, Xj) > o%. If
cov(Xo, Xn) — 0 then C, — 0, and the result follows.

10. Let X,, X2,... be independent identically distributed random variables with mean jz. The se-
quence X is stationary, and it is a consequence of the ergodic theorem that n=! vj=l Xj > Zas.

constant, and therefore P(Z = yt) = 1.

11. We have from the ergodic theorem that n~! rz 47 > E(Y | £) as. and in mean, where J is

the o-field of invariant events. The condition of the ‘question is therefore
(*) E(Y | £) = E(Y) a.s., for all appropriate Y.

Suppose (*) holds. Pick A € £, and set Y = J, to obtain 4 = Q(A) a.s. Now I, takes the values 0
and 1, so that Q(A) equals 0 or 1, implying that Q is ergodic. Conversely, suppose Q is ergodic. Then
ECY | £) is measurable on a trivial o-field, and therefore equals E(Y) a.s.

12. Suppose Q is strongly mixing. If A is an invariant event then A = t~" A. Therefore Q(A) =
QIAN tA) > Q(A)? as n —> oo, implying that Q(A) equals 0 or 1, and therefore Q is ergodic.

13. The vector X = (X 1, X2,...} induces a probability measure Q on (RT , B’). Since T is measure-
preserving, Q is stationary. Let Y : R’ — Rbe given by Y(x) = x; forx = (x1, x2,...), and define
Y; (x) = Y(ri7} (x)) where r is the usual shift operator on R?. The vector Y = (%, Yo, ...) has the
same distributions as the vector X. By the ergodic theorem for Y, n~! ri Yj > E(Y | J) as. and
in mean, where { is the invariant o-field of r. It follows that the limit
