It may be checked that X’ and Y’ have the same distributions as X and Y, and furthermore, P(X’ 4
Y’) =P(Z = 0) =1—p= hdtv (X,Y).

(e) By part (d), we may find independent pairs (X;, Y/), 1 < i < n, having the same marginals as
(X;, ¥;), respectively, and such that P(X! # ¥/) = $drv(Xi, ¥;). Now,

17. If X,, X2,... are independent variables having the Poisson distribution with parameter A, then

Sn = Xi, +X2+---+Xy has the Poisson distribution with parameter An. Now nS, » A, so that
E(g(n7! Sn)) — g(A) for all bounded continuous g. The result follows.

18. The characteristic function Wyn of

i n -i n (m — n)it
tog vin (t) = n(elt/YF™ — 1) + m(etI/mm — 1) 4 TR > 5

as m,n —> 00, implying by the continuity theorem that Umpy x N(O, 1). Now Xp + ¥y is Poisson-
distributed with parameter m + n, and therefore

Xn+Y¥n P

by the law of large numbers and Problem (3). It follows by Slutsky’s theorem (7.2.5a) that Umn / Vinn 4

19. (a) The characteristic function of Xn is dn(t) = expf{ipnt — 50217} where j4n and o2 are

the mean and variance of X,. Now, limp_soo @n(1) exists. However ¢,(1) has modulus e~ 2°,
and therefore 07 = limy—oo of, exists. The remaining component e'#*' of @,(t) converges as
n -> 00, say e'#n! —» O(t) as n -> 00 where @(t) lies on the unit circle of the complex plane. Now

ont) > a (ten 27? which is required to be a characteristic function; therefore @ is a continuous
function of t. Of the various ways of showing that 6(t) = e!#* for some y, here is one. The sequence
Wnt) = ellnt isa sequence of characteristic functions whose limit @(f) is continuous at t = 0.
Therefore 0 is a characteristic function. However y;, is the characteristic function of the constant py,
which must converge in distribution as n —> 00; it follows that the real sequence {,} converges to
some limit 2, and 6(t) = e!#? as required.
This proves that @n(t) > expf{ipt — 50°87}, and therefore the limit X is N(u, oa).

(b) Each linear combination s X, +tY, converges in probability, and hence in distribution, tos X +7rY.
Now sXy +tY, has anormal distribution, implying by part (a) that sX + ¢Y is normal. Therefore the
joint characteristic function of X and Y satisfies

x,y(8,t) = bsx4sy (1) = exp{iE(sX +t¥) — 5 var(sX +tY)}

= exp{i (sux +tyy) — 5 (s70% + 2stoxyoxoy + Pop)}
