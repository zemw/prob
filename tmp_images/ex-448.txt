This is a revised, updated and greatly expanded version of the authors’ Probability
and Random Processes: Problems and Solutions, tirst published in 1992. The 1000+
kercises contained within are not merely drill problems but have been chosen to
illustrate the concepts, illuminate the subject and both inform and entertain the
student. A broad range of subjects is covered, including: elementary aspects of
probability and random variables; sampling; Markov chains; convergence; Station
ary processes; renewals; queues; martingales; diffusion; mathematical finance and
the Black-Scholes model. A bibliography and extensive index conclude the volume

This text is intended to serye students as a companion for elementary, intermedi-
ate or advanced courses in probability and random processes. It will also be useful
for anyone needing a source for large numbers of problems in these areas, In par
ticular this text acts as a companion to the authors’ Probability and Random Processe:
Third Edition (OUP, 2001).
