(7.11.29]-[7.11.32] Solutions Convergence of random variables

Now Sx¢r) / Jkt) 4 N(O, o*) as t —> 00, by the usual central limit theorem. Therefore

which implies the first claim, since k(t)/(@t) — 1 (see Exercise (7.2.7)). The second part follows by
Slutsky’s theorem (7.2.5a).

29. We have that S, = S,; + (Sn — S,;), and so, for n > k,

E(S214,) = E(S214,) + 2E{ Se(Sn — Se)Ia, } +E{ (Sn — Sx)? 1A, }-

Now S21 At = 71 Ax; the second term on the right side is 0, by the independence of the X’s, and the
third term is non-negative. The first inequality of the question follows. Summing over k, we obtain
E(S2) > c?P(Mn > c) as required.

30. (i) With S, = 0¥_) Xi, we have by Kolmogorov’s inequality that

convergent, and therefore a.s. convergent, if “Tv E(X?2) < oo. It is shorter to use the martingale
convergence theorem, noting that S, is a martingale with uniformly bounded second moments.

Gi) Apply part (i) to the sequence Y; = X;/b, to deduce that wey Xx/bx converges a.s. The claim
now follows by Kronecker’s lemma (see Exercise (7.8.2)).

31. (a) This is immediate by the observation that
N:;

(b) Clearly vi Pi; = 1 for each i, and we introduce Lagrange multipliers {uj : i ¢ S} and write
V=AP)4+0; 4 > j Pij- Differentiating V with respect to each pj; yields a stationary (maximum)
value when (Nj; /pij) + wi = 0. Hence >, Nix = —g, and

(c) We have that Nj; = yt Nik 1, where I, is the indicator function of the event that the rth transition
out of i is to j. By the Markov property, the J, are independent with constant mean p;;. Using the

strong law of large numbers and the fact that °, Nix =‘; 00 asin -> 00, Pij “4 EW) = Pij-

32. (a) If X is transient then Vj(n) < 00 a.s., and j4; = 00, whence V;(n)/n “S$ 0 = p71. If X is
persistent, then without loss of generality we may assume Xo = i. Let T(r) be the duration of the rth
