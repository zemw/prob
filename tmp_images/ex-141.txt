10. Let W be a standard Wiener process and let F (u, v) be the event that W has no zero in the interval
(u, v).

(a) If ab > 0, show that P(F (0, t) | W(0) = a, W(t) = b) = 1- e774 /t,

(b) If W(0) = 0 and 0 < tg < ty < ty, show that

(c) Deduce that, if W(0) = 0 and 0 < ty < ty, then P(F (0, to) | F(O, t))) = /t1/ho.

Set t = 2” and w = 22"/3 and use the Borel—Cantelli lemma to show that twa) — Oas. as

12. Let W be a two-dimensional Wiener process with W(0) = w, and let F be the unit circle. What
is the probability that W visits the upper semicircle G of F before it visits the lower semicircle H?

13. Let W, and W2 be independent standard Wiener processes; the pair W(t) = (W(t), W2(t))
represents the position of a particle which is experiencing Brownian motion in the plane. Let / be
some straight line in R?, and let P be the point on / which is closest to the origin O. Draw a diagram.
Show that

(a) the particle visits /, with probability one,

(b) if the particle hits / for the first time at the point R, then the distance PR (measured as positive or
negative as appropriate) has the Cauchy density function f(x) = d/{x (d?+x2)}, —-0O <x <M,
where d is the distance OP,

(c) the angle POR is uniformly distributed on [—47, 47].

Let (W,, W2) be the planar Wiener process of Problem (13) above. Show that the pair u(W 1, W2),
v(W,, W2) is also a planar Wiener process.

15. Let M(t) = maxo<s<; W(s), where W is a standard Wiener process. Show that M(t) — W(t)
has the same distribution as M(t).

16. Let W be a standard Wiener process, u € R, and let Z = {t : W(t) = u}. Show that Z is a null
set (i.e., has Lebesgue measure zero) with probability one.

17, Let M(t) = maxo<s<; W(s), where W is a standard Wiener process. Show that M(t) is attained
at exactly one point in [0, r], with probability one.

18. Sparre Andersen theorem. Let sg = 0 and sj, = Yjel xj, where (xj : 1 < j <n) isa given
sequence of real numbers. Of the n! permutations of (x; : 1 < j < a), let Ay be the number of
permutations in which exactly r values of (sm : 0 < m < n) are strictly positive, and let B, be the
number of permutations in which the maximum of (sy, : 0 < m < n) first occurs at the rth place.
Show that Ay = B; forO <r <n. [Hint: Use induction on n.]
