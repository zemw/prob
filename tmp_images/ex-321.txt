(6.15.21]-[6.15.21] Solutions Markov chains

For any event B defined in terms of X1, X2,..., Xy—1, we have that

m=1

=P(Xy > u)P(B), O<s <u,

where we have used the fact that P(X yy > u | M = m) is independent of m. It follows that the first
record value exceeding s is independent of all record values not exceeding s. By a similar argument
(or an iteration of the above) all record values exceeding s are independent of all record values not
exceeding s.

The chance of a record value in (s,s + A] is

F(s+h)—F(s) ff (s)h
1— F(s) ~ 1 ~ F(s)

Ps <Xy<s+h)= + o(h).

A very similar argument works for the runners-up. Let Xy,,X,,.-. be the values, in order,
of offers exceeding s. It may be seen that this sequence is independent of the sequence of offers
not exceeding s, whence it follows that the sequence of runners-up is a non-homogeneous Poisson
process. There is a runner-up in (s, s + A] if (neglecting terms of order o(/)) the first offer exceeding
s is larger than s + h, and the second is in (s, s + 4]. The probability of this is

Alternatively, using conditional expectation,

$1(0) = E{E(e!°N"© | N@))} = E{O@)N}
where N(¢t) is Poisson with parameter At.
