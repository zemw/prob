[1.8.32]-[1.8.36] Exercises Events and their probabilities

(b) L includes exactly one pair of consecutive integers?

(c) the numbers in L are drawn in increasing order?

(d) your choice of numbers is the same as L?

(e) there are exactly k of your numbers matching members of L?

32. Bridge. During a game of bridge, you are dealt at random a hand of thirteen cards. With an
obvious notation, show that P(4S, 3H, 3D, 3C) ~ 0.026 and P(4S, 4H, 3D, 2C) ~ 0.018. However

if suits are not specified, so numbers denote the shape of your hand, show that P(4, 3,3, 3) ~ 0.11
and P(4, 4, 3, 2) ~ 0.22.

33. Poker. During a game of poker, you are dealt a five-card hand at random. With the convention
that aces may count high or low, show that:

PC pair) ~ 0.423, P(2 pairs) ~ 0.0475, P@ of a kind) ~ 0.021,
P(straight) ~ 0.0039, P(flush) ~ 0.0020, P(full house) ~ 0.0014,
P(4 of a kind) ~ 0.00024, P(straight flush) ~ 0.000015.

34. Poker dice. There are five dice each displaying 9, 10, J, Q, K, A. Show that, when rolled:

P(1 pair) ~ 0.46, P(2 pairs) ~ 0.23, P(3 of a kind) ~ 0.15,
P(no 2 alike) ~ 0.093, P(full house) ~ 0.039, P(4 of a kind) ~ 0.019,
P(5 of a kind) ~ 0.0008.

35. You are lost in the National Park of Bandrikat. Tourists comprise two-thirds of the visitors to

the park, and give a correct answer to requests for directions with probability 3. (Answers to repeated

questions are independent, even if the question and the person are the same.) If you ask a Bandrikan

for directions, the answer is always false.

(a) You ask a passer-by whether the exit from the Park is East or West. The answer is East. What is
the probability this is correct?

(b) You ask the same person again, and receive the same reply. Show the probability that it is correct
is 3

(c) You ask the same person again, and receive the same reply. What is the probability that it is
correct?

(d) You ask for the fourth time, and receive the answer East. Show that the probability it is correct
27

is $y.
70
(e) Show that, had the fourth answer been West instead, the probability that East is nevertheless
correct is a
36. Mr Bayes goes to Bandrika. Tom is in the same position as you were in the previous problem,
but he has reason to believe that, with probability «, East is the correct answer. Show that:
(a) whatever answer first received, Tom continues to believe that East is correct with probability «,

(b) if the first two replies are the same (that is, either WW or EE), Tom continues to believe that East
is correct with probability €,
(c) after three like answers, Tom will calculate as follows, in the obvious notation:

lle
9+ 2e°

P(East correct | EEE) = a

, P(East correct | WWW) =
1—2e

Evaluate these when € = ra
