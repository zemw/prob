k 1’s and (m — 2k) 0’s. To see this, take such an arrangement of seats, and count 0 for an unchosen
seat and 1 for a chosen pair of seats; the result is such a vector. Conversely take such a vector, read its
elements in order, and construct the arrangement of seats in which each 0 corresponds to an unchosen

seat and each 1 corresponds to a chosen pair. It follows that Nem = (™*).

Turning to Sx,, either the pair 2n, 1 is chosen or it is not. If it is chosen, we require another
k —1 pairs out of a line of 2 — 2 seats. If it is not chosen, we require k pairs out of a line of 2n seats.
Therefore

24, Think about the experiment as laying down the b + r balls from left to right in a random order.
The number of possible orderings equals the number of ways of placing the blue balls, namely ou ).
The number of ways of placing the balls so that the first k are blue, and the next red, is the number of
ways of placing the red balls so that the first is in position A + 1 and the remainder are amongst the

r+b—k-—1 places to the right, namely (” teh), The required result follows.

The probability that the last ball is red is r/(r + b), the same as the chance of being red for the
ball in any other given position in the ordering.

25. We argue by induction on the total number of balls in the urn. Let pg- be the probability that the
last ball is azure, and suppose that pac = 4 whenever a,c > 1,a+c<k. Leta ando be such that
a,o0 >1,a+o0=k-+1. Let A; be the event that i azure balls are drawn before the first carmine
ball, and let C; be the event that j carmine balls are drawn before the first azure ball. We have, by
taking conditional probabilities and using the induction hypothesis, that

Now po,o = 0 and py.o = 1. Also, by an easy calculation,

P(Aq) = = P(Co).

It follows from the above two equations that

Pao = 1(SoPaD + YPC) + 4(P(Co) — P(Aw)) = 4.

26. (a) If she says the ace of hearts is present, then this imparts no information about the other card,
which is equally likely to be any of the three other possibilities.

(b) In the given protocol, interchange hearts and diamonds.

27, Writing A if A tells the truth, and A° otherwise, etc., the only outcomes consistent with D telling
the truth are ABCD, AB°C°D, A°BC°D, and A°B°CD, with a total probability of at. Likewise, the
only outcomes consistent with D lying are A°B°C°DS, ACBCDS, AB°CD*, and ABC°D*S, with a total
probability of 3. Writing S for the given statement, we have that
