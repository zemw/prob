Conditional distributions and conditional expectation Solutions [4.5.7]-[4.6.3]

Then integrate f over this region to obtain the result. The shape of the region depends on whether or
not x < 5. The density function g of the largest angle is given by differentiation:

The expectation is found to be ig?

7. We have that E(X) = y, and therefore E(X, — X) = 0. Furthermore,

8. The condition is that E(Y) var(X) + E(X) var(Y) = 0.

9. If X and Y are positive, then S positive entails T positive, which displays the dependence. Finally,

4.6 Solutions. Conditional distributions and conditional expectation

1. The point is picked according to the uniform distribution on the surface of the unit sphere, which
is to say that, for any suitable subset C of the surface, the probability the point lies in C is the surface
integral [. (47)—! dS. Changing to polar coordinates, x = cos@ cos¢, y = sin@ cos¢, z = sing,
subject to xe 4 y? +z* = 1, this surface integral becomes (4)7! Jc | cos 6| dO dg, whence the joint
density function of © and ® is

f0,6)= Llcosgl, #1 S $x, 050 < 2x.

The marginals are then f@(0) = (Qx)7}, fo(¢) = I cos ¢|, and the conditional density functions
are

foo 16)=5-, — foo 16) = gl cos,

for appropriate 6 and @. Thus © and ® are independent. The fact that the conditional density functions
are different from each other is sometimes referred to as ‘Borel’s paradox’.

3. Take Y to be arandom variable with mean oo, say fy (y) = y forl1 < y <o,andlet ¥ = Y.
Then E(Y | X) = X which is (almost surely) finite.
