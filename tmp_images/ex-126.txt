Problems Exercises [11.8.15]-[11.8.19]

time with parameter j1; to serve any given customer. The customer at the head of the queue is served
by the first idle server; when both are idle, an arriving customer is equally likely to choose either.

(a) Show that the queue length settles into equilibrium if and only if 4 < 1 + p42.

(b) Show that, when in equilibrium, the queue length is a time-reversible Markov chain.

(c) Deduce the equilibrium distribution of queue length.

(d) Generalize your conclusions to queues with many servers.

15. Consider the D(1)/M(jz)/1 queue where 4 > 1, and let Q» be the number of people in the
queue just before the nth arrival. Let Q,, be a random variable having as distribution the stationary
distribution of the Markov chain {Q,}. Show that (1 — po!) QO, converges in distribution as yz | 1,
the limit distribution being exponential with parameter 2.

16. Taxis arrive at a stand in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity t, and passengers
arrive in the manner of an (independent) Poisson process with intensity 7. If there are no waiting
passengers, the taxis wait until passengers arrive, and then move off with the passengers, one to each
taxi. If there is no taxi, passengers wait until they arrive. Suppose that initially there are neither
taxis nor passengers at the stand. Show that the probability that n passengers are waiting at time ¢ is

(x /t)2"e— + 7, (24/1), where In (x) is the modified Bessel function, i.e., the coefficient of z”
in the power series expansion of exp(4x(z +27).

17. Machines arrive for repair as a Poisson process with intensity 4. Each repair involves two stages,
the ith machine to arrive being under repair for a time X; + Y;, where the pairs (X;, ¥;),i = 1,2,...,
are independent with a common joint distribution. Let U(t) and V(t) be the numbers of machines in
the X-stage and Y-stage of repair at time t. Show that U(t) and V(t) are independent Poisson random
variables.

18. Ruin. An insurance company pays independent and identically distributed claims {Ky :n > 1}
at the instants of a Poisson process with intensity 4, where AE(K,) < 1. Premiums are received at
constant rate 1. Show that the maximum deficit M the company will ever accumulate has moment

19. (a) Erlang’s loss formula. Consider M(1.)/M(j)/s with baulking, in which a customer departs
immediately if, on arrival, he sees all the servers occupied ahead of him. Show that, in equilibrium,
the probability that all servers are occupied is

Sig!
Ns = els where p = A/wU.
j=—0 ps /j!
(b) Consider an M(A)/M(2)/co queue with channels (servers) numbered 1,2,.... On arrival, a

customer will choose the lowest numbered channel that is free, and be served by that channel. Show
in the notation of part (a) that the fraction p, of time that channel c is busy is pe = p(%e_1 — Hc) for
c > 2, and py = 7}.
