the corresponding moment of the Poisson distribution with parameter 2.

5. Conditioning on the outcome of the first toss, we obtain hy = ghy,—1 + p( — hy_}) forn = 1,
where g = 1 — p and hg = 1. Multiply throughout by s” and sum to find that H(s) = "729 s"hn
satisfies H(s) — 1 = (q — p)sH(s) + ps/(1 —s), and so

6. Byconsidering the event that HTH does not appear in n tosses and then appears in the next three,
we find that P(X > n)p*q =P(X =n+)pq+P(X =n +3). We multiply by s"+3 and sum over

n to obtain x
1-E(s
Pas? = pqs E(s*) + E(s*),
which may be solved as required. Let Z be the time at which THT first appears, so Y = min{X, Z}.
By a similar argument,

P(Y > n)p’g =P(X =Y¥ =n+ 1)pq + P(X =¥ =n+3)+P(Z=V =n+2)p,
P(Y > n)q?p =P(Z =Y =n4+1)pqt+P(Z=Y =n+3) 4+ P(X =¥ =n42)q.

We multipy by s"+1 sum over n, and use the fact that P(Y =n) = P(X = Y =n) +P(Z =Y =n).

7. Suppose there are n + 1 matching letter/envelope pairs, numbered accordingly. Imagine the
envelopes lined up in order, and the letters dropped at random onto these envelopes. Assume that
exactly j + 1 letters land on their correct envelopes. The removal of any one of these j + 1 letters,
together with the corresponding envelope, results after re-ordering in a sequence of length n in which
exactly j letters are correctly placed. It is not difficult to see that, for each resulting sequence of length
n, there are exactly j + 1 originating sequences of length n + 1. The first result follows. We multiply
by s/ and sum over j to obtain the second. It is evident that Gj(s) = s. Either use induction, or
integrate repeatedly, to find that G,(s) = 079 (s — 1)" /rl.

8. We have for |s| < 4 + 1 that

9. Since the waiting times for new objects are geometric and independent,

E(s?) =s (=) (=) (a2):

Using partial fractions, the coefficient of s* is 3, {5(4)*-4 — 4(5)*-4 + Gy}, for k > 4.
