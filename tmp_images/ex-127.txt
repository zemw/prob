12.1 Exercises. Introduction

1. G)If (Y, F) is a martingale, show that E(Y,) = E(Yp) for all n.

Gi) If (Y, ¥) is a submartingale (respectively supermartingale) with finite means, show that E(Y,,) >
E(Yo) (respectively E(Y,) < E(Y)).

2. Let (Y, F) be a martingale, and show that E(Y;+m | Fn) = Yn for alln,m > 0.

3. Let Zy, be the size of the nth generation of a branching process with Zp = 1, having mean family
size yz and extinction probability 7. Show that Z,4—” and n2" define martingales.

4. Let {S, : n > 0} be a simple symmetric random walk on the integers with Sg = k. Show that Sy
and Ss? —nare martingales. Making assumptions similar to those of de Moivre (see Example (12.1.4)),
find the probability of ruin and the expected duration of the game for the gambler’s ruin problem.

5. Let (Y, ¥) be a martingale with the property that E(¥2) < 00 for all n. Show that, fori < j <k,
E{(Ye — ¥;)¥;} = 0, and E{(¥%, — ¥j)? | Fi} = EYP | F) - E(Y? | #;). Suppose there exists K
such that E(Y2) < K for all n. Show that the sequence {Y,,} converges in mean square as n — co.

6. Let Y be a martingale and let u be a convex function mapping R to R. Show that {u(Y,) : n > 0}
is a submartingale provided that E(u(Y,)*) < oo for all n.

Show that |Y,|, Y?, and Y,* constitute submartingales whenever the appropriate moment condi-
tions are satisfied.

7. Let Y be a submartingale and let u be a convex non-decreasing function mapping R to R. Show
that {u(Y,) : n > O} is a submartingale provided that E(u(Y,)+) < oo for all n.

Show that (subject to a moment condition) Y,t constitutes a submartingale, but that |Y,| and y2
need not constitute submartingales.

8. Let X be a discrete-time Markov chain with countable state space S and transition matrix P.
Suppose that y : S > R is bounded and satisfies Dijes Pij>W(A) < AY@ for some A > 0 and all

i € S. Show that A7~"y(X,,) constitutes a supermartingale.

9, Let G(s) be the probability generating function of the size Z, of the nth generation of a branching
process, where Zo = 1 and var(Z,) > 0. Let H, be the inverse function of the function Gy, viewed
as a function on the interval [0, 1], and show that M, = {Hy (s)}2" defines a martingale with respect
to the sequence Z.
