After a little work one obtains the mean recurrence times uw; = Fi, QQ): 4, = 43 = 4, bn =2.

(b) The chain has period 2 (if p 4 0), and all states are non-null and persistent. By symmetry, the
mean recurrence times j4; are equal. One way of calculating their common value (we shall encounter
an easier way in Section 6.4) is to observe that the sequence of visits to any given state j is a renewal
process (see Example (5.2.15)). Suppose for simplicity that p # 0. The times between successive
visits to 7 must be even, and therefore we work on a new time-scale in which one new unit equals two
old units. Using the renewal theorem (5.2.24), we obtain

pij Qn) > — if |j —iliseven, pjj(2n +1) > — if |j —i| is odd;
by Hy

note that the mean recurrence time of j in the new time-scale is 5 fj. Now > j Pij (m) = 1 for all m,
and so, letting m = 2n — ov, we find that 4/j2 = 1 where yz is a typical mean recurrence time.

There is insufficient space here to calculate p;;(n). One way is to diagonalize the transition
matrix. Another is to write down a family of difference equations of the form pj2(n) = p- poo(n —
1) + (1 — p)- paz(n — 1), and solve them.

4. (a) By symmetry, all states have the same mean-recurrence time. Using the renewal-process
argument of the last solution, the common value equals 8, being the number of vertices of the cube.
Hence py = 8.

Alternatively, let s be a neighbour of v, and let t be a neighbour of s other than v. In the obvious
notation, by symmetry,

by = 1+ 3ysv, sv =14 fusy + fur,
Mey = 1+ ZHsv + qlley + GPs My = 1+ getwy + Fltro,

a system of equations which may be solved to obtain zy = 8.
(b) Using the above equations, Lwy = 2. whence fiyw = 2 by symmetry.
(c) The required number X satisfies P(X =n) = 0”~1(1 — 6)? for n > 1, where @ is the probability

that the first return of the walk to its starting point precedes its first visit to the diametrically opposed

vertex. Therefore

5. (a) Let P;(-) = PC | Xo = i). Since i is persistent,
1=P,(Vj = 00) = Pi (Vj =0, Vi = 00) + P;(Vj > 0, Vj = 00)

< PV; =0) + P(T; < 00, Vj = 00)
<1-P,G < 00) +P; < c)P;(V; = 00),
by the strong Markov property. Since i + j, we have that P;(Vj = 00) > 1, which implies nj; = 1.

Also, P;(Tj < oo) = 1, and hence j — i and j is persistent. This implies n;; = 1.
(b) This is an immediate consequence of Exercise (6.2.4b).
