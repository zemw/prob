Some ancillary results Exercises  [7.3.4]-[7.3.10]

(a) Show that {S, = 0 1.0.} is not a tail event of the sequence {Xp}.
(b) Show that P(S, = Oi.o.) = Oif p # 4.
(c) Let T, = S;,/./n, and show that

{lim inf Tr < =x} M ¢ lim sup Th > x}

is a tail event of the sequence {Xp}, for all x > 0, and deduce directly that P(S, = Oi.o.) = Lif

p= 3.
4. Hewitt-Savage zero—one law. Let X1, X2,... be independent identically distributed random
variables. The event A, defined in terms of the X», is called exchangeable if A is invariant un-
der finite permutations of the coordinates, which is to say that its indicator function I, satisfies
TA(X1, X2,---,Xn.---) = [A(Kiy, Xin ++, Xin» Xn41,---) for all n > 1 and all permutations
(ij, i2,-.-, in) of (1, 2,..., 2). Show that all exchangeable events A are such that either P(A) = 0
or P(A) = 1.

5. Returning to the simple random walk S of Exercise (3), show that {S, = 0 i.o.} is an exchangeable
event with respect to the steps of the walk, and deduce from the Hewitt-Savage zero—one law that it
has probability either 0 or 1.

6. Weierstrass’s approximation theorem. Let f : [0, 1] — R be a continuous function, and let
Sn be a random variable having the binomial distribution with parameters n and x. Using the formula
E(Z) = E(ZI4) + E(ZI 4c) with Z = f(x) — f(n!S,) and A = {|n—!S, — x| > 5}, show that

You have proved Weierstrass’s approximation theorem, which states that every continuous function
on [0, 1] may be approximated by a polynomial uniformly over the interval.

7, Complete convergence. A sequence X;, X2,... of random variables is said to be completely
convergent to X if
SSPUXn -X|>€)<00  foralle > 0.

Show that, for sequences of independent variables, complete convergence is equivalent to a.s. conver-
gence. Find a sequence of (dependent) random variables which converges a.s. but not completely.

and finite variance. Show that
