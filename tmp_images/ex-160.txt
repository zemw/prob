Random variables and their distributions

2.1 Solutions. Random variables

1. @Ifa > 0,x € R, then {w : aX@) < x} = [wm : X(w) < x/a} € F since X is a random
variable. If a < 0,

(w: aX(w) <4} = (0: X@) > x/a)={U {o:x(o) <*— ohh
a

n>l1 n
which lies in ¥ since it is the complement of a countable union of members of F. If a = 0,

@ ifx <0,

fo: ax(w) sx) ={ Q ifx>0:

in either case, the event lies in F.
(ii) For w € Q, X(w) — X(@) = 0, so that X — X is the zero random variable (that this is a random
variable follows from part (i) with a = 0). Similarly X(w) + X(w) = 2X (@).

2. Set ¥Y =aX +b. We have that

P(X <(y —b)/a) = F((y —b)/a) ifa > 0,

PY <y)= { P(X > (y —b)/a) =1—-limypyy—sy/a F(x) ifa <0.

Finally, if a = 0, then Y = b, so that P(Y < y) equals Oifb > yand1lifb<y.
3. Assume that any specified sequence of heads and tails with length n has probability 2~”. There
are exactly (7) such sequences with k heads.

If heads occurs with probability p then, assuming the independence of outcomes, the probability of
any given sequence ofk heads andn—k tails is p*(1—p)"—*. The answer is therefore (7) p*(1—p)"—*.

4. Write H =AF+(1—A)G. Then limy_,—.9 H(x) = 0, limy_5o9 H(x) = 1, and clearly H is
non-decreasing and right-continuous. Therefore H is a distribution function.

5. The function g(F (x)) is a distribution function whenever g is continuous and non-decreasing on
(0, 1], with g(0) = 0, g(1) = 1. This is easy to check in each special case.
