(11.8.2]-[11.8.3] Solutions Queues

Now let k = 2. The queue is a birth-death process with rates
dX ifi <N, Bw ifi=1,
= tps i= ups
0 ifi>N, Qu ifi > 2.

It is reversible in equilibrium, and its stationary distribution satisfies Aj;7; = 441741. We deduce
that 7; = 2p'zo for 1 <i < N, where p = A/(2y) and

2. The answer is obtainable in either case by following the usual method. It is shorter to use the fact
that such processes are reversible in equilibrium.

(a) The stationary distribution satisfies z,Ap(n) = 7414 forn > 0, whence zn = 9p" /n! where
o =A/wp. Therefore my, = p"e7? /n!.

At the instant of arrival of a potential customer, the probability g that she joins the queue is
obtained by conditioning on its length:

3. First method. Let (Q1, Q2) be the queue-lengths, and suppose they are in equilibrium. Since
Q) is a birth-death process, it is reversible, and we write Oj; (t) = Q)(-t). The sample paths of
Q, have increasing jumps of size 1 at times of a Poisson process with intensity 4; these jumps mark
arrivals at the cash desk. By reversibility, 01 has the same property; such increasing jumps for 01
are decreasing jumps for Q1, and therefore the times of departures from the cash desk form a Poisson
process with intensity 4. Using the same argument, the quantity Q(t) together with the departures
prior to t have the same joint distribution as the quantity Q} (—t) together with all arrivals after —t.
However 01 (—t) is independent of its subsequent arrivals, and therefore Q(t) is independent of its
earlier departures.

It follows that arrivals at the second desk are in the manner of a Poisson process with intensity
A, and that Q(t) is independent of Q, (zt). Departures from the second desk form a Poisson process
also.

Hence, in equilibrium, Q; is M(A)/M(y1)/1 and Qo is M(A)/M(jz2)/1, and they are independent
at any given time. Therefore their joint stationary distribution is

mn = P(Q1(t) = m, Q2(t) =n) = (1 — pr) — pr) oF

where pj = A/L;.-
Second method. The pair (Q(t), Q2(t)) is a bivariate Markov chain. A stationary distribution
(mn : m,n > 0) satisfies
