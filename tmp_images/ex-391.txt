1. The stationary distribution satisfies 2 =P when it exists, where P is the transition matrix. The

with 7°25 2; = 1, have the given solution. If p > 1, no such solution exists. It is slightly shorter to
use the fact that such a walk is reversible in equilibrium, from which it follows that mr satisfies

2. (i) This continuous-time walk is a Markov chain with generator given by go1 = 9, 8n.n+1 =
On0/(1 + p) and gy, n-1 = On/(1 + p) for n > 1, other off-diagonal terms being 0. Such a process
is reversible in equilibrium (see Problem (6.15.16)), and its stationary distribution v must satisfy
Vn8n,nt+1 = Yn+18n+1,n- These equations may be written as

vy 64 VnOnp _ Yn41 Ont

forn > 1.

These are identical to the equations labelled (+) in the previous solution, with z, replaced by v,4,. It
follows that vy, = C/O, for some positive constant C.

Gi) If O99 =A, On, =A+ yu forn > 1, we have that

whence C = 2) and the result follows.

3. Let Q be the number of people ahead of the arriving customer at the time of his arrival. Using the
lack-of-memory property of the exponential distribution, the customer in service has residual service-
time with the exponential distribution, parameter 44, whence W may be expressed as S] ++S7+---+SQ,
the sum of independent exponential variables, parameter 4». The characteristic function of W is
