[5.12.5]-[5.12.13] Exercises Generating functions and their applications

where 0 < p < 1 andr is a positive integer. Deduce the mean and variance.

5. For the simple random walk, show that the probability po (2n) that the particle returns to the origin
at the (2n)th step satisfies po(2n) ~ (4pq)" /./mn, and use this to prove that the walk is persistent if

1
and only if p = 5. You will need Stirling’s formula: n! ~ n't de" / 2x,
6. A symmetric random walk in two dimensions is defined to be a sequence of points {(Xn, Yn) :
n > 0} which evolves in the following way: if (Xn, Yn) = (x, y) then (X41, Yn+41) is one of the
four points (x + 1, y), (x, y + 1), each being picked with equal probability i. If (Xo, Yo) = (0, 0):
(a) show that E(X?2 + ¥2) =n,
(b) find the probability pp (2n) that the particle is at the origin after the (2n)th step, and deduce that

the probability of ever returning to the origin is 1.

7. Consider the one-dimensional random walk {S,} given by

5 _ { Sn +2 with probability p,
n+l Sn — 1 with probability g = 1 — p,

where 0 < p < 1. What is the probability of ever reaching the origin starting from Sg = a where
a>0Q?

8. Let X and Y be independent variables taking values in the positive integers such that

PX =k|X+¥=n)= ({) oa — py*

for some p and all 0 < k <n. Show that X and Y have Poisson distributions.

9. In abranching process whose family sizes have mean jz and variance o”, find the variance of Zn,
the size of the nth generation, given that Zp = 1.

10. Waldegrave’s problem. A group {A), Az, ..., Ar} of r (= 2) people play the following game.
A, and A» wager on the toss of a fair coin. The loser puts £1 in the pool, the winner goes on to play
A3. In the next wager, the loser puts £1 in the pool, the winner goes on to play Ay, and so on. The
winner of the (r — 1)th wager goes on to play A, and the cycle recommences. The first person to
beat all the others in sequence takes the pool.

(a) Find the probability generating function of the duration of the game.

(b) Find an expression for the probability that A, wins.

(c) Find an expression for the expected size of the pool at the end of the game, given that A, wins.
(d) Find an expression for the probability that the pool is intact after the nth spin of the coin.

This problem was discussed by Montmort, Bernoulli, de Moivre, Laplace, and others.

11. Show that the generating function H, of the total number of individuals in the first n generations
of a branching process satisfies Hy, (s) = sG(H,_1(s)).

12. Show that the number Z, of individuals in the nth generation of a branching process satisfies
P(Zn > N | Zm =0) < Gm(O)% for n < m.

13. (a) A hen lays N eggs where N is Poisson with parameter 2. The weight of the nth egg is
Wn, where W,, W2,... are independent identically distributed variables with common probability
generating function G(s). Show that the generating function Gy of the total weight W = yy Wi
is given by Gw(s) = exp{—A + AG(s)}. W is said to have a compound Poisson distribution. Show
further that, for any positive integral value of n, Gw(s)!/" is the probability generating function of
some random variable; W (or its distribution) is said to be infinitely divisible in this regard.
