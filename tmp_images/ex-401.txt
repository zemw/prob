The mean queue length is G’(1) = 5A(2 — 4)/(1 — A). Since service times are of unit length,
and arrivals form a Poisson process, the mean residual service time of the customer in service at an
arrival time is 5, so long as the queue is non-empty. Hence

11. The length B of a typical busy period has moment generating function satisfying Mg(s) =
exp{s — 7 +AMa(s)}; this fact may be deduced from the standard theory of M/G/1, or alternatively
by a random-walk approach. Now T may be expressed as T = 7 + B where I is the length of the
first idle period, a random variable with the exponential distribution, parameter 4. It follows that
Mr(s) =AMp(s)/(A — 5). Therefore, as required,

(*) (A — s)My(s) =Aexp{s —A + (A —s)Mr(s)}.

If A > 1, the queue-length at moments of departure is either null persistent or transient, and it
follows that E(T) = oo. If 4 < 1, we differentiate («) and set s = 0 to obtain AE(T) — 1 = WE(T),
whence E(T) = {A(1 — a)}7!.

12. (a) Q is a birth-death process with parameters 4; = A, 4; = py, and is therefore reversible in
equilibrium; see Problems (6.15.16) and (11.8.3).

(b) The equilibrium distribution satisfies Ax; = uxj41 fori > 0, whence x; = (1 — p)p! where
p =A/w. A typical waiting time W is the sum of Q independent service times, so that

(c) See the solution to Problem (11.8.3).

(d) Follow the solution to Problem (11.8.3) (either method) to find that, at any time ¢ in equilibrium,
the queue lengths are independent, the jth having the equilibrium distribution of M(A)/M(u;)/1. The
joint mass function is therefore

13. The size of the queue is a birth—death process with rates A; = A, uj =  min{i, k}. Either solve
the equilibrium equations in order to find a stationary distribution 2, or argue as follows. The process
is reversible in equilibrium (see Problem (6.15.16)), and therefore A;2; = 4j412j+1 for alli. These
‘balance equations’ become

Ani = { wG+aj4, f0<i <k,

wkrj41 ifi >k.
