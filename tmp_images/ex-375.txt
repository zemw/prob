[9.7.16]-[9.7.18] Solutions Stationary processes

Similarly the indicator function of T—!A has a Fourier series,

since é,(y — a) = e ATime pg (y). Therefore I-_1 , has Fourier series

Now [4 = I,-1, since A is invariant. We compare the previous formula with that of (+), and deduce

that an = e—27""%q, for all n. Since o is irrational, it follows that an = 0 if n 4 O, and therefore I,
has Fourier series ap, a constant. Therefore J, is a.s. constant, which is to say that either P(A) = 0
or P(A) = 1.

16. Let G;(z) = E(z*™), the probability generating function of X(t). Since X has stationary
independent increments, for any n (> 1), X(t) may be expressed as the sum

X(t) = So {X(it/n) — X@ - Vt/n)}

i=1

of independent identically distributed variables. Hence X(t) is infinitely divisible. By Problem
(5.12.13), we may write

(*) Gr(z) = e MOO AQ)

for some probability generating function A, and some A(t).

Similarly, X(s +t) = X(s)+{X(s +14) — X(s)}, whence Gs+;(z) = Gs(z)G+(z), implying that
G;(z) = e#@)t for some i(z); we have used a little monotonicity here. Combining this with («), we
obtain that G;(z) = e440 -A@) for some A.

Finally, X(¢) has jumps of unit magnitude only, whence the probability generating function A is
given by A(z) = z.

17. (a) We have that
(«) X(t) — XO) = {X) -XO}+{XO-X}, Osssz,
whence, by stationarity,

{m(t) — m(0)} = {m(s) — mO)} + {m(t — 5) — mO)}.

Now m is continuous, so that m(t) — m(O) = Bt, t = 0, for some f; see Problem (4.14.5).

(b) Take variances of (*) to obtain v(t) = v(s) + u(t — s), 0 < 5 <1, whence v(t) = o2¢ for some

18. In the context of this chapter, a process Z is a standard Wiener process if it is Gaussian with
Z(Q) = 0, with zero means, and autocovariance function c(s, t) = min{s, t}.
