There are various ways of evaluating this integral. Using the result of Problem (5.12.18c), we find
that the answer is e~!‘!, whence Xj / X>2 has the Cauchy distribution.

(d) We have that

on observing that the integrand differs from the N(0, (1 + 12)~2) density function only by a multi-
plicative constant. Now, examination of a standard work of reference, such as Abramowitz and Stegun
(1965, Section 9.6.21), reveals that

where Ko(x) is the second kind of modified Bessel function. Hence the required density, by the
inversion theorem, is f(x) = Ko(|x|)/a. Note that, for small x, Kg(x) ~ —logx, and for large
positive x, Ko(x) ~ e7* fax /2.

As a matter of interest, note that we may also invert the more general characteristic function

where K is a Bessel function of the second kind.

(e) Using (d), we find that the required characteristic function is PX, Xp (bx, xO =A+ 2y71,
In order to invert this, either use the inversion theorem for the Cauchy distribution to find the required
density to be f(x) = del for -oo < x < o, or alternatively express (1 + 17)! as partial
fractions, (1 + ¢2)7! = At — it) + (1 +is)7}), and recall that (1 — it)! is the characteristic
function of an exponential distribution.

where yz is the mean vector of X, and V is the covariance matrix of X. Therefore ¢x(t) = dy(1) =
exp(ity’ — 4tVt’) by (5.8.5).
