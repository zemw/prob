37. The tree in Figure 3.2 illustrates the possibilities and probabilities. If G contains n individuals,
X is bin(n, yp + (1 — y)a) and Y is bin(n, yp). It is not difficult to see that cov(X, Y) = nyp(1—v)
where v = yp+(1—y)a. Also, var(Y) = nyp(1 — yp) and var(X) = nk(1—v). The result follows
from the definition of correlation.

38. (a) This is an extension of Exercise (3.5.2). With P, denoting the probability measure conditional
on N =n, we have that
