(5.11.4]-[5.12.2] Solutions Generating functions and their applications

(the term ‘1’ takes care of possible atoms at 0). However 1 — F(x) < pe~*, so that M(t) < 00 if
|t| is sufficiently small.

4. The characteristic function of S;,/n is {e~!4/"ly" = el, and hence S,/n is Cauchy. Hence

2. (a) The initial sequences T, HT, HHT, HHH induce a partition of the sample space. By conditioning
on this initial sequence, we obtain f(k) = gf(k — 1) + paf(k — 2) + pq f(k — 3) fork > 3,
where p+q = 1. Also f(l) = fQ) = 0, f@G3) = p>. In principle, this difference equation
may be solved in the usual way (see Appendix J). An alternative is to use generating functions.
Set G(s) = re sk Ff (k), multiply throughout the difference equation by s* and sum, to find that
G(s) = ps? /{l-—qs - pqs — p?qs?}. To find the coefficient of s*, factorize the denominator,
expand in partial fractions, and use the binomial series.

Another equation for f (k) is obtained by observing that X = k if and only if X > k — 4 and the
last four tosses were THHH. Hence

k-4
fk) = ap°(1 - + fo), k>3.
i=l

Applying the first argument to the mean, we find that 44 = E(X) satisfies wu = g(1+)+ pq(2+
14) + p?g3 + 1) + 3p? and hence u = (1+ p + p?)/p?.

As for HTH, consider the event that HTH does not occur in n tosses, and in addition the next
three tosses give HTH. The number Y until the first occurrence of HTH satisfies

P(Y > n)p*g =P(Y =n + lpg +P(Y =n +3), n> 2.

Sum over n to obtain E(Y) = (pq + 1)/(p?q).
(b) Gy (s) = (gq + ps)", in the obvious notation.

(i) PQ divides N) = 3{G NC) + Ga(—D)}, since only the coefficients of the even powers of s
contribute to this probability.

(ii) Let w be a complex cube root of unity. Then the coefficient of P(X = k) in 3{G NC) + Gy(o) +
Gy(w*)} is

s{l+o%+o%}=1, ifk =3r,

H{l+o+0"}=0, ifk=3r+1,

A{1l+o*+o}=0,  ifk=3r +2,
