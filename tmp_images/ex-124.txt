11.8 Problems

1. Finite waiting room. Consider M(A)/M(j1)/k with the constraint that arriving customers who
see N customers in the line ahead of them leave and never return. Find the stationary distribution of
queue length for the cases k = 1 and k = 2.

2. Baulking. Consider M(A)/M(j2)/1 with the constraint that if an arriving customer sees n customers

in the line ahead of him, he joins the queue with probability p(n) and otherwise leaves in disgust.

(a) Find the stationary distribution of queue length if p(m) = (vn + 17),

(b) Find the stationary distribution 2 of queue length if p(n) = 2~”, and show that the probability
that an arriving customer joins the queue (in equilibrium) is (1 — 7)/A.

3. Series. Ina Moscow supermarket customers queue at the cash desk to pay for the goods they want;
then they proceed to a second line where they wait for the goods in question. If customers arrive in the
shop like a Poisson process with parameter A and all service times are independent and exponentially
distributed, parameter jz; at the first desk and j2 at the second, find the stationary distributions of
queue lengths, when they exist, and show that, at any given time, the two queue lengths are independent
in equilibrium.

4. Batch (or bulk) service. Consider M/G/1, with the modification that the server may serve up to m
customers simultaneously. If the queue length is less than m at the beginning of a service period then she
serves everybody waiting at that time. Find a formula which is satisfied by the probability generating
function of the stationary distribution of queue length at the times of departures, and evaluate this
generating function explicitly in the case when m = 2 and service times are exponentially distributed.

5. Consider M(A)/M(j1)/1 where 4 < ys. Find the moment generating function of the length B of a

typical busy period, and show that E(B) = (yu — aw} and var(B) = (A+ p)/(u —- )3. Show that
the density function of B is

af [A
fp@) = EIR Ow (2x/Au) forx > 0

where J is a modified Bessel function.

6. Consider M(A)/G/1 in equilibrium. Obtain an expression for the mean queue length at departure
times. Show that the mean waiting time in equilibrium of an arriving customer is } AE(S?) /U—-p)
where S is a typical service time and p = AE(S).

Amongst all possible service-time distributions with given mean, find the one for which the mean
waiting time is a minimum.
7. Let W; be the time which a customer would have to wait ina M(A)/G/1 queue if he were to arrive
at time t. Show that the distribution function F(x; t) = P(W; < x) satisfies

OF OF
at ax
where S is a typical service time, independent of W;.

Suppose that F(x, t) > H(x) for all x as t > ov, where Z is a distribution function satisfying
0=h-\AH+AP(U +S <x) for x > 0, where U is independent of S with distribution function H,
and h is the density function of H on (0, 00). Show that the moment generating function My of U
satisfies

(1 — p)é

Mu (0) = 63M)

where p is the traffic intensity. You may assume that P(S = 0) = 0.
