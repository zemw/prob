[4.13.7]-[4.13.11] Solutions Continuous random variables
7. We use Exercise (4.13.6). First fix P, and then Q, to find that
E/|APQ| = E[E(|APQ| | P)] = E|APG2| = |AG;Gp|.

With b = |AB| and A the height of the triangle ABC on the base AB, we have that |G,G2| = 5b and
the height of the triangle AG; Go is fh. Hence,

E|APQ| = 4 - 4b- 3h = SABC].

8. Let the scale factor for the random triangle be X, where X € (0, 1). For a triangle with scale
factor x, any given vertex can lie anywhere in a certain triangle having area (1 — x)*|ABC]. Picking
one at random from all possible such triangles amounts to supposing that X has density function
f@ =3da- x)*, 0 <x <1. Hence the mean area is

|ABC| E(X?) = jasc} | 3x7(1 — x)’ dx = 7y|ABC].

9. We have by conditioning that, for 0 < z <a,

a 2 2a da
F(z,a+da) = F(z, a) aida + P(X 2 a2) ay + 0a)
2d 2d
= F(z, a) (1 - *<) +2." +o(da),

and the equation follows by taking the limit as da | 0. The boundary condition may be taken to be
F(a, a) = 1, and we deduce that

Likewise, by use of conditional expectation,

mr(a +da) = m,(a) (1 - ae) +E((a _ x)’) . << + o(da).

Now, E((a—X)") = a’ /(r +1), yielding the required equation. The boundary condition is m; (0) = 0,
and therefore

m= CDE ED
10. If n great circles meet each other, not more than two at any given point, then there are 2(5)
intersections. It follows that there are 4(5) segments between vertices, and Euler’s formula gives the
number of regions as n(n — 1) + 2. We may think of the plane as obtained by taking the limit as
R — oo and ‘stretching out’ the sphere. Each segment is a side of two polygons, so the average
number of sides satisfies
4n(n — 1)

11. By making an affine transformation, we may without loss of generality assume the triangle has
vertices A = (0, 1), B = (0,0), C = (1, 0). With P = (X, Y), we have that
