4. (a) Either substitute py = pz = p3 = 2 in the result of Exercise (3b), or argue as follows, with
the obvious notation. The event {A < B < C} occurs only if one of the following occurs on the first
round:

(i) A and B both rolled 6,
(ii) A rolled 6, B and C did not,
Gii) none rolled 6.
Hence, using conditional probabilities,

P(A < B<C)= (2)? +4(3)*P(B < C) + (3)°P(A < B< ©),
In calculating P(B < C) we may ignore A’s rolls, and an argument similar to the above tells us that

P(B < C) = (2)°P(B<C) +}.
Hence P(B < C) = t yielding P(A < B<C)= fuer:
(b) One may argue as above. Alternatively, let N be the total number of rolls before the first 6 appears.
The probability that A rolls the first 6 is

P(Ne{1L,4,7,...})= >> (3) = %.
k=1,4,7,...

Once A has thrown the first 6, the game restarts with the players rolling in order BCABCA. ... Hence
the probability that B rolls the next 6 is ag also, and similarly for the probability that C throws the

third 6. The answer is therefore (38)°.

5. The vector (—X; : 1 <r <n) has the same joint distribution as (X; : 1 <r <n), and the claim
follows.
Let X +2 and Y + 2 have joint mass function f, where fj; is the (@, 7)th entry in the matrix

1<i,j <3.

P(X +¥=-2)=%4 fp =P(X+Y =2).
