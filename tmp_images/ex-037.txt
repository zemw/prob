[3.11.38]-[3.11.40] Exercises Discrete random variables

number in hospital who have C (including those with C admitted for any other reason). Show that the
correlation between X and Y is

d —a)(1 — ye)
pan = |e ye
—-yp at+yce-aye

where p = a +c —ac.
It has been stated erroneously that, when p(X, Y) is near unity, this is evidence for a causal
relation between being in G and contracting C.

38. A telephone sales company attempts repeatedly to sell new kitchens to each of the N families

in a village. Family i agrees to buy a new kitchen after it has been solicited K; times, where the K;

are independent identically distributed random variables with mass function f(n) = P(K; =n). The

value oo is allowed, so that f(co) > 0. Let X, be the number of kitchens sold at the nth round of
solicitations, so that X, = we I{K;=n}- Suppose that N is a random variable with the Poisson

distribution with parameter v.

(a) Show that the X, are independent random variables, X; having the Poisson distribution with
parameter vf (r).

(b) The company loses heart after the Tth round of calls, where T = inf{n : X, = O}. Let
S = X,+X2+---+ Xr be the number of solicitations made up to time T. Show further that
E(S) = vE(F(T)) where F(k) = f(1I) + f(QQ) +--- + Ff).

39. A particle performs a random walk on the non-negative integers as follows. When at the point n

(> 0) its next position is uniformly distributed on the set {0, 1, 2,..., + 1}. When it hits 0 for the

first time, it is absorbed. Suppose it starts at the point a.

(a) Find the probability that its position never exceeds a, and prove that, with probability 1, it is
absorbed ultimately.

(b) Find the probability that the final step of the walk is from 1 to0 when a = 1.

(c) Find the expected number of steps taken before absorption when a = 1.

40. Let G be a finite graph with neither loops nor multiple edges, and write dy for the degree of
the vertex v. An independent set is a set of vertices no pair of which is joined by an edge. Let
a(G) be the size of the largest independent set of G. Use the probabilistic method to show that
a(G) > >>, 1/(dy + 1). [This conclusion is sometimes referred to as Turdn’s theorem.]
