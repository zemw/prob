[6.15.49]-[6.15.51] Solutions Markov chains

C. The transition probabilities are the averages of those for A and B, namely, pp = (tp -
ay+ (4 -aj= 3 —a, and so on. The numerator in the formula for yc equals 30 +o(1),
which is positive for small a.

49. Calla car green if it satisfies the given condition. The chance that a green car arrives on the scene
during the time interval (u, u + h) is ARP(V < x/(¢ — u)) for u < t. Therefore, the arrival process
of green cars is an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function

Au) = { AP(V <x/(t—u)) if u <t,
0 ifu>t.

Hence the required number has the Poisson distribution with mean

t t
rf e(v< +.) du=2 | P(v <=) du
0 t—u 0 u

t
= af EU (vuex}) du = AE(V—! min{x, V#}).
0

50. The answer is the probability of exactly one arrival in the interval (s, f), which equals g(s) =
AC —- sje7At-s), By differentiation, g has its maximum at s = max{0, tf — a7, and g(s) = et
when t > acl,

51. We measure money in millions and time in hours. The number of available houses has the
Poisson distribution with parameter 301, whence the number A of affordable houses has the Poisson
distribution with parameter é +301 = 5A (cf. Exercise (3.5.2)). Since each viewing time T has moment

generating function Ee®) = (78 - e’) /@, the answer is

Ga(E(e*")) = exp{5a(e7? — e? — 6)/0}.
