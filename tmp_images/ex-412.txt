Problems Solutions [12.7.1]-[12.9.2]

12.7 Solutions. Backward martingales and continuous-time martingales

1. Lets < ft. We have that E(n(X(t)) | Fs, Xs =i) = Di pij (t — s)n(j). Hence
<B(n(X(O) | Fs, Xs =1) = (Pr-sGn/); = 0,
so that E(n(X (8) | Fs, Xs =i) = ni), which is to say that E(7(X(t)) | Fs) = 4 (X(s)).
2. Let W(t) = exp{-ON(t) +410 — e*)} where 6 > 0. It may be seen that W(t A T,), t = 9,
constitutes a martingale. Furthermore
[W(t A Ta)| < exp{At A Ta) (1 — e*)} + exp{ATa(1 - ey} as t > 00,

where, by assumption, the limit has finite expectation for sufficiently small positive @ (this fact may be
checked easily). In this case, {W(t A Tz) : t => 0} is uniformly integrable. Now W(t A Tz) > W(Ta)
a.s. aS f > 00, and it follows by the optional stopping theorem that

1 = E(WO) = E(W(t A Ta) > E(W(Tq)) = € Ot Bfe*72l-8)),
Write s = e~? to obtain s~? = Ef{e*42—-s))}_ Differentiate at s = 1 to find that @ = AE(T,) and
afat+l)= WE(T2), whence the claim is immediate.

3. Let G,, be the o-field generated by the two sequences of random variables Sm, Sm41..-, Sn and
Um+1+ Um42)+-++ Un. It is a straightforward exercise in conditional density functions to see that

Um+2 (m + 1)x™71 m+1

E(Sm | $m41) = mal
whence E(Rin | $41) = R41 a8 required. [The integrability condition is elementary.]

Let T = max{m : Rm > 1} with the convention that T = 1 if Rm < 1 for all m. As in the closely
related Example (12.7.6), T is a stopping time. We apply the optional stopping theorem (12.7.5) to
the backward martingale R to obtain that E(Rr | $,) = Rn = Sn/t. Now, Rr = 1 on the event
{Rm = 1 for some m < n}, whence

~ =E(Rr | Sn = y) = P(Rm 2 1 for some m < n| Sp = y).

[Equality may be shown to hold. See Karlin and Taylor 1981, pages 110-113, and Example (12.7.6).]

12.9 Solutions to problems

1. Clearly E(Z,) < (u +m)", and hence E[¥,| < oo. Secondly, Z,41 may be expressed as

yaa X; +A, where X;, X2,... are the family sizes of the members of the nth generation, and A is
the number of immigrants to the (x + 1)th generation. Therefore E(Zn+41 | Zn) = uZn +m, whence

1 1— prt!
E(n+1 | Zn) = aay UZn+m nr ara = Vy.

2. Each birth in the (n + 1)th generation is to an individual, say the sth, in the nth generation. Hence,
for each r, Biy+1),r may be expressed in the form Bin41),r = Bn,s + B; (s), where B; (s) is the age
of the parent when its jth child is born. Therefore
