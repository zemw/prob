(10.2.3]-[10.4.1] Exercises Renewals

3. Show that E(Ty(1)44) = w(m(t)+4) for all k > 1, but that it is not generally true that E(Ty(r)) =
pm(t).

4, Show that, using the usual notation, the family {N(t)/t : 0 < t < oo} is uniformly integrable.
How might one make use of this observation?

5. Consider a renewal process N having interarrival times with moment generating function M, and
let T be a positive random variable which is independent of N. Find E(s%@)) when:

(a) T is exponentially distributed with parameter v,

(b) N is a Poisson process with intensity 4, in terms of the moment generating function of T. What
is the distribution of N(T) in this case, if T has the gamma distribution T'(v, b)?

10.3 Exercises. Excess life

1. Suppose that the distribution of the excess lifetime E(t) does not depend on t. Show that the
renewal process is a Poisson process.

2. Show that the current and excess lifetime processes, C(t) and E(t), are Markov processes.

3. Suppose that X; is non-arithmetic with finite mean pj.
(a) Show that E(t) converges in distribution as t > oo, the limit distribution function being

4. Find an expression for the mean value of the excess lifetime E(t) conditional on the event that
the current lifetime C(t) equals x.

5. Let M(t) = N(t) +1, and suppose that Xj has finite non-zero variance o?.
(a) Show that var(Tya) — uM(t)) = o7(m(@) + DD.

(b) In the non-arithmetic case, show that var(M (t))/t > a2 / we ast — 00.

10.4 Exercise. Applications
