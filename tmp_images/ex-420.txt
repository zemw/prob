Diffusion processes

13.3 Solutions. Diffusion processes

1. Itis easily seen that
E{X@+h)— X()|XO} =A-wXOh + oh),
E({X@+h) —X()}" |X) =A+u)XOA + off),
which suggest a diffusion approximation with instantaneous mean a(t, x) = (A — y2)x and instanta-
neous variance b(t, x) = (A + a)x.

2. The following method is not entirely rigorous (it is an argument of the following well-known
type: it is valid when it works, and not otherwise). We have that

aM oo 8 oo
<= / oy of dy= / {da(t, y) + 462b«, y) te” f dy,
ot —oo ot oo

by using the forward equation and integrating by parts. Assume that a(t, y) = >°, @n(t)y”, b(t, y) =
Yn Bn(t)y”. The required expression follows from the ‘fact’ that

Oy n dy = — By dy- .
[oe y fay = aan oo. f dy 39n

3. Using Exercise (13.3.2) or otherwise, we obtain the equation

M
OM mM + 40°M
ot

with boundary condition M(0, 6) = 1. The solution is M(t) = exp{ 50 (2m + O)t}.
4. Using Exercise (13.3.2) or otherwise, we obtain the equation
sad = 0 + 46°M
with boundary condition M(0, 6) = 1. The characteristics of the equation are given by

with solution M(t, 0) = e4° g(0e~*) where g is a function satisfying 1 = ea? g(@). Therefore
M = exp{qz07(1 — e~*)).
