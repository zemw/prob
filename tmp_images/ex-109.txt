[8.7.5]-[8.7.7] Exercises Random processes

5. Let X(t) = Y cos(6t) + Z sin(@t) where Y and Z are independent N(O, 1) random variables, and
let X(t) = Rcos(Ot + W) where R and W are independent. Find distributions for R and W such that
the processes X and X have the same fdds.

6. Bartlett’s theorem. Customers arrive at the entrance to a queueing system at the instants of
an inhomogeneous Poisson process with rate function A(t). Their subsequent service histories are
independent of each other, and a customer arriving at time s is in state A at time s + ¢ with prob-
ability p(s, t). Show that the number of customers in state A at time ¢ is Poisson with parameter

Jogo Mw) p(u, t — u) du.

7. Ina Prague teashop (U MySaka), long since bankrupt, customers queue at the entrance for a
blank bill. In the shop there are separate counters for coffee, sweetcakes, pretzels, milk, drinks, and
ice cream, and queues form at each of these. At each service point the customers’ bills are marked
appropriately. There is a restricted number WN of seats, and departing customers have to queue in order
to pay their bills. If interarrival times and service times are exponentially distributed and the process
is in equilibrium, find how much longer a greedy customer must wait if he insists on sitting down.
