G/G/1 Exercises [11.2.7]-[11.5.2]

7. Tandem queues. Two queues have one server each, and all service times are independent and

exponentially distributed, with parameter 4; for queue i. Customers arrive at the first queue at the

instants of a Poisson process of rate A (< min{jz1, 22}), and on completing service immediately enter

the second queue. The queues are in equilibrium. Show that:

(a) the output of the first queue is a Poisson process with intensity 4, and that the departures before
time f are independent of the length of the queue at time f,

(b) the waiting times of a given customer in the two queues are not independent.

11.3 Exercises. M/G/1

1. Consider M(A)/D(d)/1 where o = Ad < 1. Show that the mean queue length at moments of
departure in equilibrium is 5p(2 — p)/A—-p).

2. Consider M()/M(j2)/1, and show that the moment generating function of a typical busy period
is given by

_ Atn-s)-VA+p—5% —4dy
2r

for all sufficiently small but positive values of s.

3. Show that, for a M/G/1 queue, the sequence of times at which the server passes from being busy
to being free constitutes a renewal process.

11.4 Exercises. G/M/1

1, Consider G/M(j)/1, and let aj = E((ux)4 e BX /j'!) where X is a typical interarrival time.
Suppose the traffic intensity p is less than 1. Show that the equilibrium distribution w of the imbedded
chain at moments of arrivals satisfies

Look for a solution of the form 2, = 6” for some @, and deduce that the unique stationary distribution
is given by 2; = (1 — 7)n/ for j > 0, where 7 is the smallest positive root of the equation s =
Mx (us — 1)).

2. Consider a G/M(;z)/1 queue in equilibrium. Let 7 be the smallest positive root of the equation
x = Mx(u(x — 1)) where My is the moment generating function of an interarrival time. Show that
the mean number of customers ahead of a new arrival is n(1 — n)7?, and the mean waiting time is
mud — nyt.

3. Consider D(1)/M(j)/1 where jz > 1. Show that the continuous-time queue length Q(r) does not
converge in distribution as t — oo, even though the imbedded chain at the times of arrivals is ergodic.

11.5 Exercises. G/G/1

1. Show that, for a G/G/1 queue, the starting times of the busy periods of the server constitute a
renewal process.

2. Consider a G/M(j)/1 queue in equilibrium, together with the dual (unstable) M(jz)/G/1 queue.
Show that the idle periods of the latter queue are exponentially distributed. Use the theory of duality
