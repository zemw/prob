31. If X has distribution function F and characteristic function ¢, show that for t > 0

32. Let X,, X2,... be independent variables which are uniformly distributed on [0, 1]. Let My, =

max{X 1, X2,..., Xn} and show that n(1 — M,) ae X where X is exponentially distributed with
parameter 1. You need not use characteristic functions.

33. If X is either (a) Poisson with parameter A, or (b) F'(1, A), show that the distribution of Y,; =
(X — EX)//var X approaches the N(0, 1) distribution as 1 > oo.
(c) Show that

34. Coupon collecting. Recall that you regularly buy quantities of some ineffably dull commodity.
To attract your attention, the manufacturers add to each packet a small object which is also dull, and in
addition useless, but there are n different types. Assume that each packet is equally likely to contain
any one of the different types, as usual. Let 7, be the number of packets bought before you acquire

a complete set of n objects. Show that n—!(T, — nlogn) 3 T, where T is arandom variable with
distribution function P(T < x) = exp(—e™*), —0o < x < ow.

35. Find a sequence (¢,,) of characteristic functions with the property that the limit given by ¢(t) =
limy— oo Gn (t) exists for all t, but such that @ is not itself a characteristic function.

36. Use generating functions to show that it is not possible to load two dice in such a way that the
sum of the values which they show is equally likely to take any value between 2 and 12. Compare
with your method for Problem (2.7.12).

37. A biased coin is tossed N times, where N is a random variable which is Poisson distributed
with parameter A. Prove that the total number of heads shown is independent of the total number of
tails. Show conversely that if the numbers of heads and tails are independent, then N has the Poisson
distribution.

38. A binary tree is a tree (as in the section on branching processes) in which each node has exactly
two descendants. Suppose that each node of the tree is coloured black with probability p, and white
otherwise, independently of all other nodes. For any path 7 containing n nodes beginning at the root
of the tree, let B(zr) be the number of black nodes in 7, and let X,(k) be the number of such paths z
for which B(zr) > k. Show that there exists 6, such that

0 ifB> Be,
B(Xa(n)) -> { in > Be
co if B < Be,
and show how to determine the value Be.
Prove that 0 if
P(Xn (Bn) > 1) = { 1B > Bes
1 if B < Be.

39. Use the continuity theorem (5.9.5) to show that, as n > ov,
(a) if Xp is bin(n, 4/n) then the distribution of X, converges to a Poisson distribution,
