[3.11.40]-[3.11.40] Solutions Discrete random variables

It follows that

Ap —Ap-1 = rp Art — Ar), r > 3,

whence

3M = 45. +)

(r+ — Ar), r>3.

Letting r — oo, we deduce that A3 = A2 so that A, = A2 forr > 2. From (**) withr = 2,A2 = SAL
and from («) A, = Z.

(c) Let yz; be the mean duration of the walk starting from r. As above, jzg = 0, and

1
Hr = V+ (er + a ts + Mr $1), r21,

whence pp44 — Mr = (7 + Dur — My_1) — 1 forr > 2. Therefore, vp4.. = (up41 — er)/(r+D!
satisfies v,41 — ve = —1/(r +1)! forr > 2, and some further algebra yields the value of jz .

40. We label the vertices 1, 2,...,, and we let 2 be a random permutation of this set. Let K be the
set of vertices v with the property that 7(w) > 2(v) for all neighbours w of v. It is not difficult to
see that K is an independent set, whence a(G) > |K|. Therefore, a(G) > E|K| = 5°, Pv € K).
For any vertex v, a random permutation is equally likely to assign any given ordering to the set
comprising v and its neighbours. Also, v € K if and only if v is the earliest element in this ordering,
whence P(v € K) = 1/(dy + 1). The result follows.
