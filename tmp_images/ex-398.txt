together with other equations when m = 0 or n = 0. It is easily checked that these equations have the
solution given above, when p; < 1 fori = 1,2.

4, Let Dy, bethe time of the nth departure, andlet Q, = Q(Dy,+) be the number of waiting customers
immediately after D,. We have in the usual way that Q,41 = An + Qn — h(Qn), where Ay is the
number of arrivals during the (n + 1)th service time, and A(x) = min{x, m}. Let G(s) = ro ast
be the equilibrium probability generating function of the Q,. Then, since Q» is independent of An,

G(s) = E(s4")E(s Qn—h(Qn))

where oo
E(s4") = [ e46—) Fo(u) du = Ms(A(s — 1)),

Combining these relations, we obtain that G satisfies

whenever it exists.
Finally suppose that m = 2 and Ms(@) = u/(u — 8). In this case,

_ eros +1) +715}
G(s) = p(s +1) —As2

Now G(1) = 1, whence (279 + 21) = 244 — A; this implies in particular that 2u — 7 > 0. Also
G(s) converges for |s| < 1. Therefore any zero of the denominator in the interval [—1, 1] is also a
zero of the numerator. There exists exactly one such zero, since the denominator is a quadratic which

takes the value —A at s = —1 and the value 24 — 4 at s = 1. The zero in question is at

and it follows that zg + (7% + 21)s9 = 0. Solving for 9 and 21, we obtain

G(s) = l-a

where a = 2A/{u + Vu? + 4Au}.
5. Recalling standard M/G/1 theory, the moment generating function Mg satisfies
