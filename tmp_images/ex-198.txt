Expectation Solutions [4.3.1]-[4.3.5]

4.3 Solutions. Expectation

1. (a) E(X*%) = f° x%e~* dx < 00 if and only if a > —-1.

(b) In this case
CO Clx|*
E(\x|* -| ——,— d.
(|X|") “oo AED x < 00

if and only if —1 <a@ < 2m —1.
2. We have that

An xX; n
1=E (He ‘) = > E(X;/Sn).
i=]
By symmetry, E(X;/Sn) = E(X1/S») for all i, and hence 1 = nE(X,/S,). Therefore

E(Sm/Sn) =) | E(Xi/Sn) = mE(X1/Sn) = m/n.

i=l
3. Either integrate by parts or use Fubini’s theorem:

OO OO le ¢)
rf x’ P(X > x) dx =r | xt! { foyay} dx

=x

= [rot fe #} dy = [ y" f(y) dy.

An alternative proof is as follows. Let I, be the indicator of the event that X > x, so that
for I, dx = X. Taking expectations, and taking a minor liberty with the integral which may be made
rigorous, we obtain EX = Io° EC) dx. A similar argument may be used for the more general case.

4. We may suppose without loss of generality that 4 = 0 ando = 1. Assume further that m > 1.
In this case, at least half the probability mass lies to the right of 1, whence E(XJ;y>m}) = 3 Now
0 = E(X) = E{X[I(x>mj + [tx <m)]}, implying that EX Ix <m)) < —}. Likewise,
E(X7Ix>m}) = 4, E(X?Ix<m}) < 4.
By the definition of the median, and the fact that X is continuous,
E(X |X <m)<-—l, E(X2|X <m) <1.

It follows that var(X | X < m) <0, which implies in turn that, conditional on {X < m}, X is almost
surely concentrated at a single value. This contradicts the continuity of X, and we deduce that m < 1.
The possibility m < —1 may be ruled out similarly, or by considering the random variable — X.

5. Itis a standard to write X = X* — X~ where X* = max{X, 0} and X~ = — min{X, 0}. Now
Xt and X~ are non-negative, and so, by Lemma (4.3.4),

p= EX) = BX+)— BA) = [Pex > dx [Px < —x)dx

It is a triviality that

i jb
w= Fajds + [ [1 — F(x) dx
0 0

and the equation follows with a = y. It is easy to see that it cannot hold with any other value of a,
since both sides are monotonic functions of a.
