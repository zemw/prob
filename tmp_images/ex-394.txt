It is easily seen that A(O) = My(u(0 — 1)) is convex and non-decreasing on [0, 1], and satisfies
A(0) > 0, AC) = 1. Now A’(1) = wE(X) = pal > 1, implying that there is a unique 7 € (0, 1)
such that A(y) = 7. With this value of 7, the vector m given by aj = (1 — nani, j = 0, isa
stationary distribution of the imbedded chain. This x is the unique such distribution because the chain
is irreducible.

2. (i) The equilibrium distribution is x, = (1 —)n” for n > 0, with mean reo nt =n/(1—7n).
(ii) Using the lack-of-memory property of the service time in progress at the time of the arrival, we

see that the waiting time may be expressed as W = Sj + Sz +--- + Sg where @ has distribution zr,
given above, and the S;, are service times independent of Q. Therefore

3. Wehave that Q(n+) = 1+ Q(n—) as. for each integer n, whence lim;-+99 P(Q(t) = m) cannot
exist.

Since the traffic intensity is less than 1, the imbedded chain is ergodic with stationary distribution
as in Exercise (11.4.1).

1. Let 7, be the starting time of the nth busy period. Then 7; is an arrival time, and also the
beginning of a service period. Conditional on the value of T,,, the future evolution of the queue is
independent of the past, whence the random variables {T,4, — Ty : n > 1} are independent. It is
easily seen that they are identically distributed.

2. If the server is freed at time T, the time J until the next arrival has the exponential distribution
with parameter yz (since arrivals form a Poisson process).

By the duality theory of queues, the waiting time in question has moment generating function
My (s) = (1 — 6)/(1 — ¢M7(s)) where M7 (s) = w/(u — 5) and = P(W > 0). Therefore,

the moment generating function of a mixture of an atom at 0 and an exponential distribution with
parameter jz(1 — Z).

If G is the probability generating function of the equilibrium queue-length, then, using the lack-
of-memory property of the exponential distribution, we have that My (s) = G(u/(u—s)), since W is
the sum of the (residual) service times of the customers already present. Set u = /(j4—s) to find that
G(u) = (1 —¢)/(1 — fy), the generating function of the mass function f(k) = (1 — eck fork > 0.
