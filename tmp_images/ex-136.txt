Stochastic calculus Exercises [13.3.9]-[13.7.1]

9. Exponential martingale, geometric Brownian motion. Let W be a standard Wiener process

and define S(t) = e#+8W). Show that:

(a) Sis a Markov process,

(b) S is a martingale (with respect to the filtration generated by W) if and only if a + 4p = 0, and
in this case E(S(t)) = 1.

10. Find the transition density for the Markov process of Exercise (9a).

13.4 Exercises. First passage times

1. Let W bea standard Wiener process and let X(t) = exp{i0 W(t) + 4672} where i = /—1. Show
that X is a martingale with respect to the filtration given by F; = o ({W(u) : u < t}).

2. Let T be the (random) time at which a standard Wiener process W hits the ‘barrier’ in space-time
given by y = at+bwherea <0, b > 0; thatis, T = inf{t : W(t) = at+b}. Use theresult of Exercise
(1) to show that the moment generating function of T is given by E(e¥? ) = exp{—b(./a? — 2y+a)}
for y < 5a’. You may assume that the conditions of the optional stopping theorem are satisfied.

3. Let W be a standard Wiener process, and let T be the time of the last zero of W prior to time t.
Show that P(T <u) = (2/m)sin7! /u/t, O<u <t.

13.5 Exercise. Barriers

1. Let D be a standard Wiener process with drift m starting from D(0) = d > 0, and suppose that
there is a reflecting barrier at the origin. Show that the density function f(t, y) of D(t) satisfies
f't, y) > 0 ast > co ifm > 0, whereas f(t, y) > 2|\mle~2!"I9 for y > 0, ast > ooifm <0.

13.6 Exercises. Excursions and the Brownian bridge

1. Let W be a standard Wiener process. Show that the conditional density function of W(t), given
that W(u) > Ofor 0 <u <t, is g(x) = (x/t)e7?/20), x>0.

2. Show that the autocovariance function of the Brownian bridge is c(s,t) = min{s, 7} — st,0 <
syt<1.

3. Let W bea standard Wiener process, and let W(t) = W(t)—1W (1). Show that (W(t) :0 <1 < 1}
is a Brownian bridge.

4. If W is a Wiener process with W (0) = 0, show that Wit) =(1-—-fWct/d —1t)) for0 <t <1,
W(1) = 0, defines a Brownian bridge.

5. LetO < s < +? < 1. Show that the probability that the Brownian bridge has no zeros in the
interval (s, t) is (2/2) cos! /@ —s)/[F —5)].
