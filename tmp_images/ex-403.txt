[11.8.15]-[11.8.17] Solutions Queues

This gives a stationary distribution if and only if 1 < 41 + 2, under which assumption 79 is easily
calculated.

A similar analysis is valid if there are s servers and an arriving customer is equally likely to go
to any free server, otherwise waiting in turn. This process also is reversible in equilibrium, and the
stationary distribution is similar to that given above.

15. We have from the standard theory that Q,, has as mass function m=Ud- mn ,j = 0, where
n is the smallest positive root of the equation x = e“@—))_ The moment generating function of

My(0) = Rexp{9 = w)Qu}) = papa’

Writing 4 = 1 + €, we have by expanding e#M-D as a Taylor series that 7 = n(€) = 1 — 2€ + ofe)
as € | 0. This gives

2€ + o(e) _ 2€ + o(€) 2
—(1—-2e)(1 +e) +0(-) (2-O)e+o0(e—) 2-0

M,() = 1

as € | 0, implying the result, by the continuity theorem.

16. The numbers P (of passengers) and T (of taxis) up to time t have the Poisson distribution with
respective parameters zt and tt. The required probabilities p, = P(P = T +n) have generating

in which the coefficient of z” is easily found to be that given.

17. Let N(t) be the number of machines which have arrived by time t. Given that V(t) =n, the times
T, Tn,..., Tn of their arrivals may be thought of as the order statistics of a family of independent
uniform variables on [0, t], say U,, Uz2,..., Un; see Theorem (6.12.7). The machine which arrived
at time U; is, at time t,

in the X-stage a(t)
in the Y-stage > with probability < 6(t)
repaired 1—a(t) — B®)

where a(t) = P(UU + X > t) and B(t) =P(U +X <t < U+X+/Y), where U is uniform on (0, £],
and (X, Y) is a typical repair pair, independent of U. Therefore
