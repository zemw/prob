and so F,(x) > x for 0 < x < 1. On the other hand, cos(2nz x) does not converge unless x € {0, 1},
and therefore f,(x) does not converge on (0, 1).

3. We may express N as the sum N = 7; + T, + ---+ J; of independent variables each having the

5. Let X be uniformly distributed on [—a, a], Y be uniformly distributed on [—b, b], and let X and
Y be independent. Then X has characteristic function sin(at)/(at), and Y has characteristic function
sin(bt)/(bt). We apply the inversion theorem (5.9.1) to the characteristic function of X + Y to find
