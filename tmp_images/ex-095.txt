[7.2.2]-{7.3.3] Exercises Convergence of random variables

2. Dominated convergence. Suppose |X,| < Z for alln, where E(Z) < oo. Prove that if Xp, & X
then Xp, 4 X.

3. Give a rigorous proof that E(XY) = E(X)E(Y) for any pair X, Y of independent non-negative
random variables on (Q, ¥,P) with finite means. [Hint: For k > 0, n > 1, define X, = k/n if

k/n < X < (K+ 1)/n, and similarly for Y,. Show that X, and Y, are independent, and X, < X,
and Y, < Y. Deduce that EX, — EX and EY, — EY, and also E(X,Y,) > E(XY).]

4. Show that convergence in distribution is equivalent to convergence with respect to the Lévy metric

of Exercise (7.1.4).

5. (a) Suppose that Xp, 5 X and Y, a c, where c is aconstant. Show that X,Yp » cX, and that
Xn/Yn > X/cifc £0.

(b) Suppose that X, » 0 and Y, # Y, and let ¢: IR2 —> R be such that g(x, y) is a continuous

function of y for all x, and g(x, y) is continuous at x = 0 for all y. Show that g(Xn, Yn) a
g(0, Y).
[These results are sometimes referred to as ‘Slutsky’s theorem(s)’.]
6. Let X,, X2,... be random variables on the probability space (Q, ¥, P). Show that the set
A = {wm €  : the sequence X,,(w) converges} is an event (that is, lies in #), and that there exists a

random variable X (that is, an #-measurable function X : Q — R) such that X,(w) > X(@) for
MEA.

7. Let {X,} be a sequence of random variables, and let {cy} be a sequence of reals converging to the
limit c. For convergence almost surely, in rth mean, in probability, and in distribution, show that the
convergence of X, to X entails the convergence of cy Xp tocX.

8. Let {X,} be a sequence of independent random variables which converges in probability to the
limit X. Show that X is almost surely constant.

9. Convergence in total variation. The sequence of discrete random variables X,, with mass
functions fy, is said to converge in total variation to X with mass function f if

Ss" in(z) — f)| +0 as n> oo.

Suppose X, — X in total variation, and u : R > R is bounded. Show that E(u(Xn)) ~ E(u(X)).

10. Let {X; : r => 1} be independent Poisson variables with respective parameters {A; :r > 1}. Show
that 57°, X; converges or diverges almost surely according as }-?°, Ay converges or diverges.

7.3 Exercises. Some ancillary results

1. (a) Suppose that Xy, a X. Show that {X,} is Cauchy convergent in probability in that, for all
€ > 0, P(\Xn — Xm| > €) ~ 048 n,m — ov. In what sense is the converse true?

(b) Let {Xp} and {Y,} be sequences of random variables such that the pairs (X;, X;) and (Y;, Yj)

have the same distributions for all i, 7. If Xp a X, show that Y, converges in probability to
some limit Y having the same distribution as X.

2. Show that the probability that infinitely many of the events {A, : n > 1} occur satisfies
P(A, 1.0.) > lim supy_,o9 P(An).

3. Let {S, : 2 > 0} be a simple random walk which moves to the right with probability p at each
step, and suppose that Sg = 0. Write Xp = Sy — Sy-1.
