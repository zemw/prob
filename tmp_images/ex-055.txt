[4.14.50]-[4.14.56] Exercises Continuous random variables

(b) In sampling from the density function f, it is decided to use a rejection method: for given a > 0,
we sample U and V repeatedly, and we accept X the first time that Y > 3(X — a). What is the
optimal value of a?

(c) Describe how to use these facts in sampling from the N (0, 1) distribution.

50. Let S be a semicircle of unit radius on a diameter D.
(a) A point P is picked at random on D. If X is the distance from P to S along the perpendicular to
D, show E(X) = 1/4.
(b) A point Q is picked at random on S. If Y is the perpendicular distance from Q to D, show
E(Y) = 2/zx.
51. (Set for the Fellowship examination of St John’s College, Cambridge in 1858.) ‘A large quantity
of pebbles lies scattered uniformly over a circular field; compare the labour of collecting them one by
one:
(i) at the centre O of the field,
(ii) at a point A on the circumference.’
To be precise, if Lo and La are the respective labours per stone, show that E(Lo) = fa and
E(La) = 32a/(97) for some constant a.
Gii) Suppose you take each pebble to the nearer of two points A or B at the ends of a diameter. Show
in this case that the labour per stone satisfies

E(L =f — log(l 2exzldl =a.
(Lap) {5 5 V2 + 5 log +v5h 3x 3a

(iv) Finally suppose you take each pebble to the nearest vertex of an equilateral triangle ABC inscribed
in the circle. Why is it obvious that the labour per stone now satisfies E(Lagc) < E(Lo)?
Enthusiasts are invited to calculate E(L apc).

52. The lines L, M, and N are parallel, and P lies on L. A line picked at random through P meets M
at Q. A line picked at random through Q meets N at R. What is the density function of the angle ©
that RP makes with L? [Hint: Recall Exercise (4.8.2) and Problem (4.14.4).]

53. Let A denote the event that you can form a triangle with three given parts of a rod R.

(a) R is broken at two points chosen independently and uniformly. Show that P(A) = i.

(b) R is broken in two uniformly at random, the longer part is broken in two uniformly at random.
Show that P(A) = log(4/e).

(c) R is broken in two uniformly at random, a randomly chosen part is broken into two equal parts.
Show that P(A) = 4.

(d) In case (c) show that, given A, the triangle is obtuse with probability 3 — 2/2.

54. You break a rod at random into two pieces. Let R be the ratio of the lengths of the shorter to the
longer piece. Find the density function fr, together with the mean and variance of R.

55. Let R be the distance between two points picked at random inside a square of side a. Show that
E(R2) = za’, and that R*/a? has density function

56. Show that a sheet of paper of area A cm? can be placed on the square lattice with period 1 cm in
such a way that at least [A] points are covered.
