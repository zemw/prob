These are easily solved iteratively to obtain

Therefore

(1 —a)(4 - a)
Viewed as a function of a, the numerator is a cubic taking the value 4A at a = O and the value —3B
at a = 1. This cubic has a unique zero at some a* € (0, 1), and C, < C» if and only if 0 < a < a*.

14. The state of the system is the number Q(t) of customers within it at time t. The state 1 may be
divided into two sub-states, being o, and 02, where og; is the state in which server i is occupied but
the other server is not. The state space is therefore § = {0, 01, 02, 2,3, ...}.

The usual way of finding the stationary distribution, when it exists, is to solve the equilibrium
equations. An alternative is to argue as follows. If there exists a stationary distribution, then the
process is reversible in equilibrium if and only if

for ali sequences i;,i2,..., iz of states, where G = (guy)y,veg is the generator of the process (this
may be shown in very much the same way as was the corresponding claim for discrete-time chains
in Exercise (6.5.3); see also Problem (6.15.16)). It is clear that («) is satisfied by this process for all
sequences of states which do not include both o1 and 02; this holds since the terms gyy are exactly
those of a birth-death process in such a case. In order to see that («) holds for a sequence containing
both o1 and o», it suffices to perform the following calculation:
