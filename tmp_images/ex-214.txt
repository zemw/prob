coordinates of (X, Y), and note that ¥ = © and e~ 22° = R?. The random variables Q and W are

independent, and, by a change of variables, Q has density function fg(q) = ge? , q > 0. We
recognize the distribution of (Q, VY) as that of the polar coordinates of (X, Y) where X and Y are
independent N(0, 1) variables. [Alternatively, the last step may be achieved by a two-dimensional
change of variables.]

11. Suppose g is increasing, so that h(x) = —g(1 — x) is increasing also. By the FKG inequality of
Problem (3.11.18b), « = cov(g(U), —g(i — U)) = 0, yielding the result.

Estimating J by the average (2n)7! ria g(U,) of 2n random vectors U; requires a sample
of size 2n and yields an estimate having some variance 2nc?. If we estimate J by the average
(2n)7! {7.1 8(Ur) + gl — U,)}, we require a sample of size only n, and we obtain an estimate

with the smaller variance 2n (a2 —K).

(b) This is immediate from the fact that the variance of a sum of independent variables is the sum of
their variances; see Theorem (3.3.11b).

(c) This is an application of the strong law of large numbers, Theorem (7.5.1).

13. (a) If U is uniform on [0, 1], then X = sin(37 U) has the required distribution. This is an example
of the inverse transform method.

(b) If U is uniform on [0, 1], then 1 — U? has density function g(x) = {2/T—x}"', O0< x <1.
Now g(x) = (1/4) f(x), which fact may be used as a basis for the rejection method.
