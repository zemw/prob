filtration to be specified.

5. Let (Y, &) be a submartingale and let S and T be stopping times satisfying 0 < S < T < N for
some deterministic N. Show that EYp < EY; < EY; < EYy.

6. Let {S,} be a simple random walk with Sg = 0 such thatO < p = P(Sy = 1) < h. Use de
Moivre’s martingale to show that E(sup,, Sm) < p/(1 — 2p). Show further that this inequality may
be replaced by an equality.

7. Let Fbe a filtration. For any stopping time T with respect to F, denote by ¥7 the collection of
all events A such that, for alln, AN {T <n} € F,. Let S and T be stopping times.

4. Let {S, : n > 0} be a simple symmetric random walk with 0 < Sg < N and with absorbing
barriers at 0 and N. Use the optional stopping theorem to show that the mean time until absorption is
