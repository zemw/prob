It is a function of random variable $X$, and therefore it is a random variable itself.\n:::\n\nConditional distribution is a key concept in probability, describing how the distribution of one random variable depends on the values of other variables—an idea central to many practical applications. For instance, we might be interested in how income distributions vary by education level or how the probability of a disease changes with age.\n\nConditional expectation gives the expected value of one variable given the value of another. It is frequently used for making predictions, such as predicting your earnings given that you graduate from a this college.\n\n![Given each value of X, there is a distribution of Y\\|X.
