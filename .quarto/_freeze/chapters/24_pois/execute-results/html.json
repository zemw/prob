Poisson distribution is used to\nmodel independent events occurring at a constant mean rate. It is like\nthe Binomial distribution in the sense that they both model the number\nof occurrence of events, but it is parametrized on the \"rate\" of the\nevent (how many times an event occurs in a unit of time on average)\nrather than the total number of events and the probability of each\nevent. It is therefore more practical in real-world modeling since we\nmostly observe the rate rather than the totality. We introduce the\nPoisson distribution by showing that it is a limiting case of the\nBinomial distribution.\n\n**Question:** Suppose we are studying the distribution of the number of\nvisitors to a certain website. Every day, a million people independently\ndecide whether to visit the site, with probability $p=2\\times10^{-6}$ of\nvisiting. What is the probability of getting $k$ visitors on a\nparticular day?\n\nWe can model the problem with a Binomial distribution. Let\n$X\\sim \\text{Bin}(n,p)$ be the number of visitors, where $n=10^{6}$ and\n$p=2\\times10^{-6}$. But it is easy to run into computational\ndifficulties with such a large $n$ and small $p$. This is not uncommon,\nif we want to model the number of emails one receives per day, or the\nnumber of phone calls in a service center. In such cases, we could\nreasonably assume $n\\to\\infty$ and $p\\to0$ while $np=\\lambda$ is a\nconstant. We may call $\\lambda$ --- the \"rate\", as it can be interpreted\nas the average visitors per day.\n\nTake limit of the Binomial distribution:\n$$\\begin{aligned}P(X=k)= & \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\binom{n}{k}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}\\\\\n= & \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\binom{n}{k}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{k}\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{n-k}\\\\\n= & \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}\\cdot \\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{n^{k}}\\underbrace{\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{n}}_{\\to e^{-\\lambda}}\\underbrace{\\left(1-\\frac{\\lambda}{n}\\right)^{-k}}_{\\to1}\\\\\n= & \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\underbrace{\\frac{n!}{n^{k}(n-k)!}}_{\\to1}\\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{k!}e^{-\\lambda}\\\\\n= & \\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{k!}e^{-\\lambda}.\n\\end{aligned}$$ This is the PMF of the Poisson distribution.\n\n::: callout-note\n## The limiting definition of exponential function\n\n$$e^x = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{x}{n}\\right)^n$$\n:::\n\n::: {#def-pois}\n## Poisson distribution\n\nA random variable $X$ has the Poisson distribution with parameter\n$\\lambda$ if the PMF of $X$ is\n\n$$P(X=k)=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{k}}{k!},\\quad k=0,1,2,\\ldots$$\n\nWe denote this as $X\\sim\\textrm{Pois}(\\lambda)$.\n:::\n\nWe can easily verify this is a valid PMF because\n$\\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{k!}=e^{\\lambda}$.\n\n::: {#thm-pois}\nIf $X\\sim \\text{Bin}(n,p)$ and we let $n\\to\\infty$ and $p\\to0$ such that\n$\\lambda=np$ remains fixed, then the PMF of $X$ converges to the PMF of\n$\\text{Pois}(\\lambda)$.\n:::\n\nThe expectation of the Poisson distribution is\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}E(X)= & \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty}k\\cdot\\frac{e^{-\\lambda}\\lambda^{k}}{k!}\\\\\n= & e^{-\\lambda}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{k}}{(k-1)!}\\\\\n= & \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\\\\\n= & \\lambda e^{-\\lambda}e^{\\lambda}=\\lambda.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](24_pois_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#exm-4.20}\nContinued with the website visiting example, there are one million\npeople visiting the site every day, each with probability\n$p=2\\times10^{-6}$. Give an approximation for the probability of getting\nat least three visitors on a particular day.\n\nLet $X$ be the number of visitors. Since $n$ is large, $p$ is small,\n$np=2$ is fixed, $X$ is well approximated by $\\text{Pois}(2)$.\nTherefore, $$\\begin{aligned}\nP(X\\geq3)=1-P(X<3) & =1-P(X=0)-P(X=1)-P(X=2)\\\\\n & =1-e^{-2}-2e^{-2}-\\frac{2^{2}}{2!}e^{-2}\\\\\n & =1-5e^{-2}\\approx0.32.\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n\nThe Poisson distribution is often used in situations where we are\ncounting the number of successes in a particular region or interval of\ntime, where there are a large number of trials, each with a small\nprobability of success. The Poisson paradigm says in situations like\nthis, we can approximate the number of successes by a Poisson\ndistribution. It is more general than @thm-pois, as we relax the\nassumption of independence and identical events.\n\n::: {#prp-pois}\n## Poisson paradigm\n\nLet $A_{1},\\dots,A_{n}$ be events with $p_{j}=P(A_{j})$, where $n$ is\nlarge, the $p_{j}$ are small, and the $A_{j}$ are independent or weakly\ndependent. Then $X=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}I(A_{j})$, that is how many of the\n$A_{j}$ occur, is approximately distributed as $\\text{Pois}(\\lambda)$\nwith $\\lambda=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}p_{j}$.\n:::\n\nThe Poisson paradigm is also called the *law of rare events*. The\ninterpretation of \"rare\" is that the $p_{j}$ are small, but $\\lambda$ is\nrelatively stable. The number of events that occur may not be exactly\nPoisson, but the Poisson distribution often gives good approximations.\nNote that the conditions for the Poisson paradigm to hold are fairly\nflexible: the $n$ trials can have different success probabilities, and\nthe trials don't have to be independent, though they should not be very\ndependent. So there are a wide variety of situations that can be cast in\nterms of the Poisson paradigm. This makes the Poisson a very popular\nmodel.\n\nPoisson distribution is also used to model the number of **events\noccurring randomly over time** with **constant rate**, such as the\nnumber of customers visiting a store, the number of phone calls to a\ncall center, and so on.\n\nWhy the random occurrence of events has anything to do with the Poisson\ndistribution? Consider in this way: one can divide the time line into\ninfinitely small intervals (e.g. milliseconds). In each interval, an\nevent either happens or not. The chance that an event occurs in a\nmillisecond is very small. While there are infinitely many trials. So\ncounting events occurring randomly at a fixed average rate over time is\nmathematically equivalent to counting rare events in many trials.\n\n::: {#def-pois-proc}\n## Poisson process\n\nA sequence of arrivals in continuous time is a Poisson process with rate\n$\\lambda$ per unit of time if\n\n-   The number of arrivals in an interval of length $t$ is distributed\n    $\\text{Pois}(\\lambda t)$;\n-   The numbers of arrivals in disjoint time intervals are independent.\n:::\n\n",
