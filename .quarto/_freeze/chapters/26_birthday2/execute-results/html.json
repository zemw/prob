Now we revisit the birthday problem with Poisson\ndistribution. \n\n::: {#exm-4.22}\nIf we have $m$ people and $\\binom{m}{2}$ pairs. Each pair of people has\nprobability $p=1/365$ of having the same birthday. Find the probability\nof at least one match.\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThe probability of match is small, and the number of pairs is large. We\nconsider using the Poisson paradigm to approximate the number $X$ of\nbirthday matches. $X\\approx Pois(\\lambda)$ where\n$\\lambda=\\binom{m}{2}\\frac{1}{365}$. Then the probability of at least\none match is $$P(X\\geq1)=1-P(X=0)\\approx1-e^{-\\lambda}.$$ For $m=23$,\n$\\lambda=253/365$ and $1-e^{-\\lambda}\\approx0.5$, which agrees with our\nprevious finding that we need 23 people to have 50% chance of a birthday\nmatch.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-4.23}\nContinued with the assumption above. What's the probability of two\npeople who were born not only on the same day, but also at the same hour\nand the same minute?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThis is the birthday problem with $c=365\\cdot24\\cdot60=525600$\ncategories rather than $365$ categories. By Poisson approximation, the\nprobability of at least one match is approximately $1-e^{-\\lambda_{1}}$\nwhere $\\lambda_{1}=\\binom{m}{2}\\frac{1}{525600}$. This would require\n$m=854$ to reach the break even point, 50% chance of getting a match.\n:::\n\nYou may wonder how good the Poisson approximation is. We can compare it with\nthe true values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# compute the probability of coincidences for 1,2...100 people\nn <- 1:100\np <- sapply(n, pbirthday)\n\n# approximate the probability by Poisson paradigm\nlambda <- choose(n, 2)/365\nq <- 1 - exp(-lambda)\n\n# black line is the true probability\n# red line is the Poisson approximation\nplot(n, p, type = \"s\")\nlines(n, q, col = 2, type=\"s\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](26_birthday2_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n",
