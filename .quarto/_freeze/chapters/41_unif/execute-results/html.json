Let $X$ be a\nrandom variable such that it is known that $a\\leq X\\leq b$ and, for\nevery subinterval of $[a,b]$, the probability that $X$ will belong to\nthat subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval. We\nthen say that the random variable $X$ has the Uniform distribution on\nthe interval $[a,b]$. The PDF of $X$ is $$f(x)=\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{1}{b-a} & \\textrm{for }a\\leq x\\leq b\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}$$\n:::\n\nThis is a valid PDF since\n$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{+\\infty}f(x)dx=\\int_{a}^{b}\\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\\frac{1}{b-a}\\int_{a}^{b}dx=1.$$\n\nThe CDF of $X$ is\n\n$$F(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^{x}f(t)dt=\\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt=\\begin{cases}\n0 & x<a\\\\\n\\frac{x-a}{b-a} & a\\leq x\\leq b\\\\\n1 & x>b\n\\end{cases}.$$\n\nThe expectation of $X$:\n\n$$E(X)=\\int_{a}^{b}x\\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\\frac{1}{b-a}\\left[\\frac{x^{2}}{2}\\right]_{a}^{b}=\\frac{a+b}{2}.$$\n\nTo figure out the variance, first compute\n\n$$E(X^{2})=\\int_{a}^{b}x^{2}\\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\\frac{1}{b-a}\\left[\\frac{x^{3}}{3}\\right]_{a}^{b}=\\frac{a^{2}+ab+b^{2}}{3}$$\n\nThus,\n\n$$Var(X)=E(X^{2})-E^{2}(X)=\\frac{a^{2}+ab+b^{2}}{3}-\\frac{(a+b)^{2}}{4}=\\frac{(b-a)^{2}}{12}.$$\n\n::: {#exm-stick}\n### Longer piece of a broken stick\nA stick of unit length is broken at a random point X. What is the\nexpected length of the longer piece?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThe lengths of the two pieces are $X$ and $1-X$, with $X\\sim U(0,1)$.\nThe longer piece is $\\max(X,1-X)$. For $X<0.5$, the longer piece is\n$1-X$, and for $X\\geq0.5$, it is $X$. The expected value is:\n$$E[\\max(X,1-X)]=\\int_{0}^{0.5}(1-X)\\,dx+\\int_{0.5}^{1}X\\,dx=\\frac{3}{4}.$$\n:::\n\nIntuition might suggest that since the stick is broken at a random\npoint, the longer piece should be \"somewhat larger\" than the shorter\npiece, but not as large as 3/4. However, the uniform distribution of the\nbreak point means that the longer piece can sometimes be much larger\nthan the shorter piece, especially when the break point is close to one\nend.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of simulations\nN <- 1000\n\n# simulate random break point\nX <- runif(N, min = 0, max = 1)  \n\n# length of the longer piece\nL <- pmax(X, 1 - X)  \n\ncat(\"Expected Length of Longer Piece:\", mean(L))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nExpected Length of Longer Piece: 0.7547885\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: {#exm-buffon2}\n### Buffon's needle revisited\nA plan is ruled by the lines $y=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2,...$ and a needle of unit length\nis cast randomly on to the plane. What is the probability that it intersects\nsome line? \n:::\n\n::: solution\nLet $Z$ be the distance from the needle's center to the nearest line beneath it.\nLet $\\Theta$ be the angle made by the needle and the $x$-axis.\nThe fact that the needle is cast randomly means $Z\\sim U(0,1)$, $\\Theta\\sim U(0,\\pi)$ \nand $Z$ and $\\Theta$ are independent. Thus the joint density function of $(Z,\\Theta)$ is\n$$f(z,\\theta)=\\frac{1}{\\pi},\\quad 0\\leq z\\leq 1,0\\leq\\theta\\leq\\pi.$$\nAn intersection occurs if and only if (draw a diagram to see this):\n$$z \\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta\\textrm{ or }1-z \\leq\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta$$\nHence\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nP(\\text{intersection})\n& =\\frac{1}{\\pi}\\int_0^\\pi\\left(\n  \\int_0^{\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta}dz + \\int_{1-\\frac{1}{2}\\sin\\theta}^1 dz\n  \\right)d\\theta \\\\\n&= \\frac{2}{\\pi}.\n\\end{aligned}$$\n:::\n",
