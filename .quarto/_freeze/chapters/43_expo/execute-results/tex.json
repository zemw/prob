What interests us is the waiting time \nuntil the next customer arrives. \n\nLet $X$ represent the waiting time. \nSince the customers arrives randomly, the likelihood of it\ncoming in the next moment is the same whether you've been waiting for\none minute or ten minutes. \nIn other words, the probability of waiting another $t$ minutes is the same \nno matter how long you've already waited. Therefore,\n$$P(X\\geq s+t\\mid X\\geq s)=P(X\\geq t),\\quad\\forall s,t\\geq0.$$\nThe conditional probability can be rewritten using the definition of\nconditional probabilities:\n$$P(X\\geq s+t\\mid X\\geq s)=\\frac{P(X\\geq s+t)}{P(X\\geq s)}.$$ Thus, the\nmemoryless property implies:\n$$\\frac{P(X\\geq s+t)}{P(X\\geq s)}=P(X\\geq t).$$ Let the survival\nfunction $S(x)$ represent $P(X\\geq x)$ . Substituting $S(x)$ into the\nequation gives: $$\\frac{S(s+t)}{S(s)}=S(t).$$ This reminds us of the\nexponential function. In fact, the only continuous and non-negative\nsolution to this equation is: $$S(x)=e^{-\\lambda x},\\quad\\lambda>0,$$\nwhere $\\lambda$ is a positive constant. This solution represents the\nprobability that the waiting time exceeds $x$ , and $\\lambda$ determines\nhow quickly the probability decreases over time.\n\nThe CDF of $X$ is exactly the opposite of $S(x)$:\n$$F(x)=1-S(x)=1-e^{-\\lambda x}.$$ Take derivative to get the PDF:\n$$f(x)=F'(x)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}.$$\n\n::: {#def-expo}\n### Exponential distribution\n\nA random variable $X$ is said to have the Exponential distribution with\nparameter $\\lambda$ if its PDF is\n$$f(x)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x},\\qquad x>0.$$\n\nWe denote this as $X\\sim\\textrm{Exp}(\\lambda).$$\\lambda$ is interpreted\nas the \"rate\", i.e. number of events per unit of time.\n:::\n\nTo compute the expectation and variance, we first standardize the\nexponential distribution. Let $Y=\\lambda X$, then\n$Y\\sim\\textrm{Exp}(1)$, because\n$$P(Y\\leq y)=P(X\\leq y/\\lambda)=1-e^{-y}.$$ It follows that,\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nE(Y) & =\\int_{0}^{\\infty}ye^{-y}dy=\\left[-ye^{-y}\\right]_{0}^{\\infty}+\\int_{0}^{\\infty}e^{-y}dy=1;\\\\\nVar(Y) & =E(Y^{2})-(EY)^{2}=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}y^{2}e^{-y}dy-1=1.\\end{aligned}$$\nFor $X=Y/\\lambda$, we have $E(X)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$,\n$Var(X)=\\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}}$.\n\n::: {#thm-memoryless}\n### Memoryless property\nIf $X$ has the exponential distribution with parameter $\\lambda$, and\nlet $t>0$, $h>0$, then $$P(X\\geq t+h|X\\geq t)=P(X\\geq h).$$\n:::\n\n::: proof\nFor $t>0$ we have\n$$P(X\\geq t)=\\int_{t}^{\\infty}\\lambda e^{-\\lambda x}dx=e^{-\\lambda t}.$$\nHence for each $t>0$ and each $h>0$,\n$$P(X\\geq t+h|X\\geq t)=\\frac{P(X\\geq t+h)}{P(X\\geq t)}=\\frac{e^{-\\lambda(t+h)}}{e^{-\\lambda t}}=e^{-\\lambda h}=P(X\\geq h).$$ \n:::\n\nThe memoryless property is a very special property of the Exponential\ndistribution. In fact, the Exponential is the only memoryless continuous\ndistribution (with support $(0,\\infty)$); and Geometric distribution is\nthe only memoryless discrete distribution (with support $0,1,\\dots$).\n\n::: {#thm-expo}\n### Poisson-Exponential connection\nLet $T$ be the time between two consecutive events in Poisson process\n$\\text{Pois}(\\lambda t)$. Then $T$ follows Exponential distribution\n$T\\sim\\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$.\n:::\n\n::: proof\nThe waiting time $T>t$ is equivalent to no event occurred during period\n$t$. Therefore,\n$$P(T>t)=P(N_{t}=0)=e^{-\\lambda t}\\frac{(\\lambda t)^{0}}{0!}=e^{-\\lambda t}$$\nwhere $N_{t}$ is the number of events occurred in $[0,t]$, which follows\na Poisson distribution. The CDF of $T$ is\n\n$$F(t)=1-P(T>t)=1-e^{-\\lambda t}$$\n\nThe PDF of $T$ is $$f(t)=F'(t)=\\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}$$ This indicates\n$T\\sim \\text{Exp}(\\lambda)$.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-waiting-time}\n### Bus arrivals\nWe try to model the waiting time at a bus station. Suppose the bus\narrives at random time but on average there will be one bus per 10\nminutes. You arrive at the bus stop at a random time, not knowing how\nlong ago the previous bus came. What is the distribution of your waiting\ntime for the next bus? What is the mean waiting time? What is the median\nwaiting time?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThe bus arrivals in a period of time is best modeled by a Poisson distribution. \nLet $X$ be the waiting time and we know it is an Exponential\ndistribution. Since $E(X)=1/\\lambda=10$, $X\\sim\\textrm{Exp}(1/10)$. \nThus, The average waiting time is always 10 minutes.\n\nThe CDF of $X$ is $F(x)=1-e^{-\\lambda x}$. The median $m$ satisfies\n$F(m) = 1/2$. Thus, $m= \\log(2)/\\lambda \\approx 6.9$ minutes. So the\ntypical waiting experienced by most passengers is less than 10 minutes.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulate random arrivals and inter-arrival time\n\nN <- 600  # total simulation time\np <- .1   # prob of occurrence per unit time\n\nset.seed(0)  \n\n# I[t] = 1 if an event occurs in time t \nI <- 1* (runif(N) < p)  \n\npar(mfrow=c(1,2))\n\n# plot the random occurrence\nplot(1:N, I, type = \"h\")\n\n# inter-arrival time\nT <- diff( (1:N)[I==1] )\n\n# distribution if waiting time  \nhist(T, prob=TRUE)\n\n# Overlay the exponential function\ncurve(exp(-x/10)/10, col = 2, add = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](43_expo_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-1-1.pdf){fig-pos='H'}\n:::\n:::\n\n",
