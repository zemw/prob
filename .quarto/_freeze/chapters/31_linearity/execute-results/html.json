This allows us to break down a problem into easy-to-solve\nsmall problems. For example, if $X = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb{I}_{A_i}$,\nthen: $$E[X] = \\sum_{i=1}^n E[\\mathbb{I}_{A_i}] = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A_i)$$\n\n::: {#exm-4.6}\nIn a group of $n$ people, what is the expected number of distinct\nbirthdays among the $n$ people (the expected number of days on which at\nleast one of the people was born)? What is the expected number of people\nsharing a birthday (any day)?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nLet $X$ be the number of distinct birthdays, and write\n$X=I_{1}+\\cdots+I_{365}$, where $$I_{j}=\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\textrm{if someone was born on day }j\\\\\n0 & \\textrm{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}.$$ Then $$\\begin{aligned}\nE(I_{j}) & =P(\\textrm{someone was born on day }j)\\\\\n & =1-P(\\textrm{no one was born on day }j)\\\\\n & =1-\\left(\\frac{364}{365}\\right)^{n}.\\end{aligned}$$ Then by\nlinearity, $$E(X)=365\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{364}{365}\\right)^{n}\\right).$$\nLet $Y$ be the number of people sharing a birthday, and\n$Y=J_{1}+\\cdots+J_{n}$ where $J_{k}$ is an indicator that the $j$-th\nperson shares his birthday with somebody else. $$\\begin{aligned}\nE(J_{k}) & =P(\\textrm{someone shares birthday with }k)\\\\\n & =1-P(\\textrm{no one shares birthday with }k)\\\\\n & =1-\\left(\\frac{364}{365}\\right)^{n-1}.\\end{aligned}$$ Therefore,\n$$E(Y)=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}E(J_{k})=n\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{364}{365}\\right)^{n-1}\\right).$$\n\nFor some numeric values, $E(Y)=2.3$ if $n=30$; $E(Y)=6.3$ if $n=50$.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-4.8}\nLet $\\Pi$ be a permutation over $\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$. That is a reordering\nof the numbers. A fixed point of a permutation are the points not moved\nby the permutation. For example, in the permutation below\n$$\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\\n\\Pi & 2 & 4 & 3 & 1\n\\end{array}$$\n\nThe fixed point is 3. Find the expected number of fixed points of a\nrandom permutation.\n:::\n\n::: solution\nLet $X$ be the number of fixed points of a random permutation. Then\n$X=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\Pi(k)=k}$ where\n$\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\Pi(k)=k}$ indicates the $k$-th number stays the same\nafter the permutation. By linearity,\n$$E(X)=E\\left(\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\Pi(k)=k}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}E\\left(\\boldsymbol{1}_{\\Pi(k)=k}\\right)=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{n}=1.$$\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-buffon}\n### Buffon's needle\nA plan is ruled by the lines $y=0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2,...$ and a needle of unit length\nis cast randomly on to the plane. What is the probability that it intersects\nsome line? \n:::\n\n::: solution\nHere we sketch an intuitive approach. \nA more rigorous one will be given in @exm-buffon2.\n\nLet $X$ be the number of times the needle crosses a line. \nThe needle can cross a line either $1$ or $0$ times. Thus,\n$P(\\text{intersection})=E(X)$.\n\nConsider dropping any (continuous) curve of unit length onto the surface.\nDivide the curve into $N$ straight line segments, each of length $1/N$. \nLet $X_{i}$ be the indicator for the $i$-th segment crossing a line. Then,\n$$E(X)=E\\left(\\sum X_{i}\\right)=\\sum E(X_{i})=N\\cdot E(X_{i}).$$ \nWe don't necessarily have to compute this expectation, but by this line of reasoning: \n$E(X)$ is proportional to the length of the curve, *regardless* the shape of the curve. \nIf we can compute $E(X)$ for some curve, then $E(X)$ is the same for all curves with the same length.\n\nConsider a circle of diameter $d=1$. The circle always crosses the lines\ntwice for sure. That is, $E(X_{\\textrm{circle}})=2$. The length of the\ncircle is $\\pi$. Therefore, for any curve (including a needle) of length $\\pi$ \nwe have $E(X_\\pi)=2$. \n\nFor a needle of unit length, scale it down by $\\pi$, we have $E(X)=2/\\pi$.\nTherefore, $$P(\\text{intersection})=\\frac{2}{\\pi}.$$\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# number of simulations\nN <- 10000\n\n# number of crossings\nX <- numeric(N)\n\nset.seed(0)\n\n# run simulation\nfor (i in 1:N) {\n  \n  # randomly generate the position of the needle's midpoint\n  # distance from the nearest line\n  y <- runif(1, min = 0, max = 1/2)  \n  \n  # randomly generate the angle of the needle (in radians)\n  θ <- runif(1, min = 0, max = pi/2)  \n  \n  # check if the needle crosses a line\n  if (y <= 1/2 * sin(θ)) X[i] <- 1\n  else X[i] <- 0\n}\n  \nπ <- 2 / mean(X)\n  \ncat(\"Estimated value of π:\", π)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nEstimated value of π: 3.140704\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n",
