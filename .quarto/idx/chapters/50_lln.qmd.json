{"title":"Law of large numbers","markdown":{"headingText":"Law of large numbers","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nWe now introduce two important theorems describing the behavior of the\nsample mean as the sample size grows. Throughout this section and the\nnext, we assume $X_{1},X_{2},\\dots,X_{n}$ are i.i.d RVs drawn from a\npopulation with mean $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^{2}$. The sample mean is\ndefined as\n\n$$\\bar{X}_{n}=\\frac{X_{1}+\\cdots+X_{n}}{n}.$$\n\nAs we have discussed previously, the sample mean is itself a random\nvariable with mean and variance:\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nE(\\bar{X}_{n}) & =\\frac{1}{n}E(X_{1}+\\cdots+X_{n})=\\frac{1}{n}(E(X_{1})+\\cdots+E(X_{n}))=\\mu,\\\\\nVar(\\bar{X}_{n}) & =\\frac{1}{n^{2}}Var(X_{1}+\\cdots+X_{n})\\overset{iid}{=}\\frac{1}{n^{2}}(Var(X_{1})+\\cdots+Var(X_{n}))=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}.\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe law of large numbers (LLN) says that as n grows, the sample mean\n$\\bar{X}_{n}$ converges to the true mean $\\mu$.\n\n::: {#thm-7.1}\n(Strong law of large numbers). The sample mean $\\bar{X}_{n}$ converges\nto the true mean $\\mu$ point-wise as $n\\to\\infty$, with probability $1$.\nIn other words, the event $\\bar{X}_{n}\\to\\mu$ has probability $1$.\n:::\n\n::: {#thm-7.2}\n(Weak law of large numbers). For all $\\epsilon>0$,\n$P(|\\bar{X}_{n}-\\mu|>\\epsilon)\\to0$ as $n\\to\\infty$. (this is known as\nconverge in probability).\n:::\n\nWe don't need a rigorous proof here. But an intuitive proof is obvious.\nAs $n\\to\\infty$, $Var(\\bar{X}_{n})=\\frac{\\sigma^{2}}{n}\\to0$. The random\nvariable $\\bar{X}_{n}$ becomes fixed at $\\mu$ as $n$ becomes large.\nThus, it converges to $\\mu$ in a probabilistic sense.\n\nIt seems that the LLN just states the obvious. But it has wide\napplications in daily time that you might not even realize. What it says\nis essentially this: the uncertainty at the individual level becomes\ncertain when aggregating together; the risks that are unmanageable at\nthe individual level becomes manageable collectively. Think about a rare\ndisease, it happens at 1 out of a million probability. For each\nindividual, no one knows if they will get the disease or not. But as the\nsample size gets large, suppose we have one billion population, the LLN\nsays the sample mean will be very close the true mean. That is, there\nwill be almost surely 1000 people being infected by the disease. We\nprovide two more examples.\n\n::: {#exm-7.1}\n(Lottery). A lottery company is designing a game with a 6-digit format.\nEach time someone buys a ticket, they receive a randomly generated\n6-digit number. Only one number will win the grand prize of 10 million\ndollars. What should the company charge per ticket to break even?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThe probability of winning the game is $p=1/10^{6}$. Suppose the company\nhas sold $n$ tickets. The price for each ticket is $x$. The revenue for\nthe company is therefore $xn$. By the LLN, the cost of the company\nshould be very close to $10^{7}np$. The break even point is\n$xn=10^{7}np$. So $x=10^{7}p=10$. Therefore, if the company sells each\nticket above 10 dollars. The business is surely profitable as long as\n$n$ is large. If the company is a monopoly, it can reap as much profit\nas it desires as long as they know the basic probability theory! The\nsame can be said about gambling companies.\n:::\n\n::: {#exm-7.2}\n(Insurance). Insurance is anther great application of the LLN. It is\nessentially the same as the the lottery game but most people do not\nrealize it. Suppose there is a disease with infection rate of 1 out of 1\nmillion. The medical expenditure to cure the disease is 10 million\ndollars. How much the insurance company should charge per customer to\ncover this disease?\n:::\n\n::: solution\nThe solution is essentially the same as above. Suppose the premium for\nthe insurance product is $x$. The revenue of the company by selling the\npremium is $xn$. The cost is --- when one customer is infected, the\ncompany has to pay the medical cost ---$10^{7}np$. The break even price\nfor the insurance premium is thus $10$ dollars.\n\nWhat is the implication of this insurance? Without the insurance, each\nindividual either chooses to set aside 10 million dollars pre-cautiously\nfor the disease (if he is rich enough) or be exposed to the risk\ncompletely uncovered. The insurance product enables everyone to get\ncovered at a cost of just 10 dollars. It is a typical example that the\nunmanageable risk at the individual level becomes manageable\ncollectively.\n:::\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"50_lln.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
