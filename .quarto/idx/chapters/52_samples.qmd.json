We have also\nintroduced various distributions suitable to model different kinds of\nevents. However, we never observe the full distribution or the true\nparameters of the assumed distribution. Instead, we only observe a\nsample of that random variable. We can only infer the properties of the\ndistribution from a limited sample. For example, suppose we model the\nheight of an Asian women with a normal distribution. But we never know\nexactly what the mean and variance are. We can only observe a sample of\nthe distribution.\n\nIn statistics, the conceptual distribution $F$ is called the\n**population distribution**, or just the **population**.[^stat-1] It is\ntempting to think of the population as all the observations (e.g. all\nthe population on the planet), but this is not exactly correct. The\npopulation distribution is more of a mathematical abstraction or an\nassumption. Suppose we are modeling the height of human being, even if\nwe have all the observations on the planet, that does not include the\npeople that have died or yet to be born. Thus, it is still a sample of\nthe assumed distribution.\n\n[^stat-1]: This section is based on Bruce Hansen's *Probability and\n    Statistics for Economists*.\n\nA collection of random variables $\\{X_{1},X_{2},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$ is a\n**random sample** from the population $F$ if $X_{i}$ are **independent\nand identically distributed (*i.i.d*)** with distribution $F$. What we\nmean by *i.i.d* is that $X_{1},\\dots,X_{n}$ are mutually independent and\nhave exactly the same distribution $X_{i}\\sim F$. Survey sampling is an\nuseful metaphor to understand random sampling, in which we randomly\nselect a subset of the population with equal probability. The **sample\nsize** $n$ is the number of individuals in the sample.\n\nA **data set** is a collection of numbers, typically organized by\nobservation. We sometimes call a data set also as a sample. But it\nshould not be confused with the random sample defined above. As the\nformer is a collection of random variables, whereas the latter is one\n**realization** of the random variables.\n\nTypically, we will use $X$ without the subscript to denote a random\nvariable or vector with distribution $F$, $X_{i}$ with a subscript to\ndenote a random observation in the sample, and $x_{i}$ or $x$ to denote\na specific or realized value.\n\nThe problem of **statistical inference** is to learn about the\nunderlying process --- the population distribution or data generating\nprocess --- by examining the observations. In most cases, we assume the\npopulation distribution and want to learn about the its parameters (e.g.\n$\\mu$ and $\\sigma^{2}$ in the normal distribution). As a convention, we\nuse greek letters to denote population parameters.\n\nA **statistic** is a function of the random sample\n$\\{X_{1},X_{2},\\dots,X_{n}\\}$. Recall that there is a distinction\nbetween random variables and their realizations. Similarly there is a\ndistinction between a statistic as a function of a random sample --- and\nis therefore a random variable as well --- and a statistic as a function\nof the realized sample, which is a realized value. When we treat a\nstatistic as random we are viewing it is a function of a sample of\nrandom variables. When we treat it as a realized value we are viewing it\nas a function of a set of realized values. One way of viewing the\ndistinction is to think of \"before viewing the data\" and \"after viewing\nthe data\". When we think about a statistic \"before viewing\" we do not\nknow what value it will take. From our vantage point it is unknown and\nrandom. After viewing the data and specifically after computing and\nviewing the statistic the latter is a specific number and is therefore a\nrealization. It is what it is and it is not changing. The randomness is\nthe process by which the data was generated --- and the understanding\nthat if this process were repeated the sample would be different and the\nspecific realization would be therefore different. The distribution of a\nstatistic is called the **sampling distribution**, since it is the\ndistribution induced by sampling.\n\nAn **estimator** $\\hat{\\theta}$ for a population parameter $\\theta$ is a\nstatistic intended to infer $\\theta$. It is conventional to use the hat\nnotation $\\hat{\\theta}$ to denote an estimator. Note that $\\hat{\\theta}$\nis a statistic and hence also a random variable. We call $\\hat{\\theta}$\nan **estimate** when it is a specific value (or realized value)\ncalculated in a specific sample.\n\nA standard way to construct an estimator is by the analog principle. The\nidea is to express the parameter $\\theta$ as a function of the\npopulation $F$, and then express the estimator $\\hat{\\theta}$ as the\nanalog function in the sample.\n\nFor example, suppose we want to construct an estimator for the\npopulation mean $\\mu=E(X)$. By definition, if each value of $X$ is of\nequal probability, $\\mu$ is simply the average. By analogy, we construct\nthe **sample mean** as $\\bar{X}_{n}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_{i}$. It\nis conventional to denote a sample average by the notation \"X bar\".\nBecause it is an estimator for $\\mu$, we also denote it as\n$\\hat{\\mu}=\\bar{X}_{n}$. Note that from different samples we calculate\ndifferent estimates. In one sample, $\\hat{\\mu}=6.5$; in another sample,\n$\\hat{\\mu}=6.7$. All of them are erroneous estimate of the true\nparameter $\\mu$. The question is therefore how close they are to the\ntrue parameter. To answer this question, we need to study the\ndistribution of the sample mean.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"52_samples.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
