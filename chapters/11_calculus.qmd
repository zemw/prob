## Review of calculus*

Calculus is a prerequisite to work with continuous distributions. The
following chapters assume readers are proficient in calculus. We
nonetheless review some basic concepts here as a warm-up. This review is
not exhaustive, so please refer to a specific textbook if needed for a
more comprehensive understanding.

### Differentiation {.unnumbered}

We define the derivative of a function $f(x)$ to be
$$f'(x)=\lim_{h\to0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$$

Loosely speaking, a function is continuous if there is no jump in the
graph, differentiable if the curve is smooth. Some commonly used
derivatives:

$$\begin{aligned} & \frac{d}{dx}(x^{n}) & = & nx^{n-1}\\
 & \frac{d}{dx}(e^{x}) & = & e^{x}\\
 & \frac{d}{dx}(\ln(x)) & = & \frac{1}{x}\\
 & \frac{d}{dx}(\sin(x)) & = & \cos(x)\\
 & \frac{d}{dx}(\cos(x)) & = & -\sin(x)\\
 & (fg)' & = & f'g+fg'\\
 & \left(\frac{f}{g}\right)^{'} & = & \frac{f'g-fg'}{g^{2}}\\
 & [f(g(x))]' & = & f'(g(x))g'(x)
\end{aligned}$$

When dealing with limits of the form "$\frac{0}{0}$" or
"$\frac{\infty}{\infty}$", the L'Hospital rule is very handy.
$$\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}.$$

One important application of derivatives is the Taylor's theorem, which
gives the approximation of a function around a given point by
polynomials. Assume function $f$ is at least $k$ times differentiable,
then

$$f(x)=f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)+\frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x-a)^{2}+\cdots+\frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^{k}+\cdots$$

which means we can approximate a function arbitrarily well by higher
order polynomials. Some commonly used Taylor series (expanding around
$a=0$):

$$\begin{aligned} & \frac{1}{1-x} & = & 1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+\cdots\quad\textrm{for }|x|<1\\
 & e^{x} & = & 1+x+\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\cdots\\
 & \sin x & = & x-\frac{x^{3}}{3!}+\frac{x^{5}}{5!}-\frac{x^{7}}{7!}+\cdots\\
 & \cos x & = & 1-\frac{x^{2}}{2!}+\frac{x^{4}}{4!}-\frac{x^{6}}{6!}+\cdots\\
 & \ln(1+x) & = & x-\frac{x^{2}}{2}+\frac{x^{3}}{3}-\frac{x^{4}}{4}+\cdots\quad\textrm{for }|x|<1\\
 & \arctan(x) & = & x-\frac{x^{3}}{3}+\frac{x^{5}}{5}-\frac{x^{7}}{7}+\cdots\quad\textrm{for }|x|\leq1
\end{aligned}$$

### Approximating $\pi$ with Taylor series
Taylor series are one of the most amazing results in calculus. For
example, in the last formula, if we let $x=1$:
$$\frac{\pi}{4}=\arctan(1)=1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\cdots$$
Therefore, we can approximate $\pi$ by summing up a sequence of
fractions:
$$\pi=4\left(1-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{7}+\cdots\right).$$

### Integration {.unnumbered}

Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation. Integral has
the geometric interpretation as the area under the curve. Let $A(x)$ be
the area under the curve of $y=f(x)$. Thus $A(x)=\int_{0}^{x}f(t)dt$.
The change of the area resulted from a tiny little change of $x$ is
approximated by $A(x+h)-A(x)\approx f(x)h$. That is
$\frac{A(x+h)-A(x)}{h}=f(x)$. If the change is infinitesimal, $h\to0$,
we have $A'(x)=f(x)$.

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: if $F$ is the anti-derivative of
$f$, then

$$F(x)=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt$$ $$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=F(b)-F(a)$$

One interpretation of the integral is --- the integral of a rate of
change of a quantity gives the net change in that quantity. Think about
speed and distance: $\int_{a}^{b}v(t)dt=s(b)-s(a)$.

Because the integral is just a sum over infinitely many approximating
rectangles,
$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(x_{i})\Delta x$.
Integrals behave just like sums. For example,
$\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$ has the interpretation of the average
of $f(x)$ from $a$ to $b$.

Indefinite integrals are the general antiderivatives without specifying
the interval of the integration. It always comes with a constant $C$.
Some commonly used integrals:

$$\begin{aligned} & \int dx & = & x+C\\
 & \int x^{n}dx & = & \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C\\
 & \int e^{x}dx & = & e^{x}+C\\
 & \int\frac{1}{x}dx & = & \ln|x|+C\\
 & \int\cos(x)dx & = & \sin(x)+C\\
 & \int\sin(x)dx & = & -\cos(x)+C\\
 & \int\frac{1}{1+x^{2}}dx & = & \arctan(x)+C
\end{aligned}$$

Two common integration techniques are *substitution* and *integration by
parts*.

### Integration by substitution
Find $\int\sqrt{3x+2}dx$.
:::

::: solution
Let $u=3x+2$, then $du=3dx$. Then
$$\int\sqrt{3x+2}dx=\frac{1}{3}\int\sqrt{u}du=\frac{2}{9}u^{3/2}+C=\frac{2}{9}(3x+2)^{3/2}+C.$$

### Integration by parts
Find $\int x\sin xdx$.
:::

::: solution
Integration by parts follows the formula:
$$\int f(x)g'(x)dx=f(x)g(x)-\int f'(x)g(x)dx$$
Let $f(x)=x$, $g'(x)=\sin x$. Then $g(x)=-\cos x$. Then,
$$\int x\sin xdx=-x\cos x-\int(-\cos x)dx=-x\cos x+\sin x+C.$$
