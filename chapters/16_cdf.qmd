## Cumulative distribution function

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable $X$ is
the function $F$ given by $F(x)=P(X\leq x)$.

For discrete random variables, $F(x)=\sum_{k\leq x}p(k)$.

For continuous random variables, $F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(t)dt$. We
thus have $\frac{dF(x)}{dx}=f(x)$.

Unlike PMF or PDF, a cumulative distribution function can be defined for
both discrete and continuous random variables. CDF gives the full
distribution of a random variable. Given the CDF, we can figure out any
probability distribution of the random variable:
$$P(x_{1}<x\leq x_{2})=F(x_{2})-F(x_{1}).$$

::: {#prp-cdf}
Any CDF has the following properties:

-   $P(X>x)=1-F(x)$

-   $P(x_{1}<x\leq x_{2})=F(x_{2})-F(x_{1})$

-   Increasing: if $x_{1}\leq x_{2}$, then $F(x_{1})\leq F(x_{2})$.

-   Right-continuous: for any $a$, $F(a)=\lim_{x\to a+}F(x)$.

-   $F(x)\to0$ as $x\to-\infty$; $F(x)\to1$ as $x\to+\infty$.

The CDF for a continuous random variable is
[differentiable]{.underline}, while the CDF for a discrete random
variable consists of jumps and ï¬‚at regions.
