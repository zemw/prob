Texas hold'em is one of the most popular variant of the card game of
poker. Essentially, the players in the game bet on the rankings of their
hand of five cards (illustrated in the figure below). For the game to be
fair, a hand of higher values must have lower probability than a hand of
lower values. In this example, we compute the probabilities of different
patterns of cards (assuming a total of 52 cards, excluding the 2
jokers).

::: solution
To compute the probabilities of different five-card poker hands, we
first determine the total number of possible five-card hands from a
standard 52-card deck. The total number of combinations is:
$$\binom{52}{5} = \frac{52 \times 51 \times 50 \times 49 \times 48}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2,598,960$$

Now, we find the number of combinations for each hand type and use this
to compute the probabilities.

1.  Straight Flush

    A straight flush consists of five consecutive cards of the same
    suit. There are 10 possible sequences (A-5 through 10-A), and each
    sequence can occur in any of the 4 suits. Thus, the total number of
    straight flushes is: $4 \times 10 = 40$. The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Straight Flush}) = \frac{40}{2598960} \approx 0.00154\%$$

2.  Four of a Kind (Quads)

    Four of a kind consists of four cards of the same rank plus one
    additional card. There are 13 possible ranks, and for each rank,
    there are 4 cards that form the quads. The fifth card can be any of
    the remaining 48 cards. Therefore, the total number of quads is:
    $13 \times 48 = 624$. The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Four of a Kind}) = \frac{624}{2598960} \approx 0.024\%$$

3.  Full House

    A full house consists of three cards of one rank and two cards of
    another rank. The number of ways to choose the rank for the triplet
    is $\binom{13}{1} = 13$ , and the number of ways to choose 3 cards
    of that rank is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ . The number of ways to choose
    the rank for the pair is $\binom{12}{1} = 12$ , and the number of
    ways to choose 2 cards of that rank is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ .
    Therefore, the total number of full houses is:
    $13 \times 4 \times 12 \times 6 = 3744$. The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Full House}) = \frac{3744}{2598960} \approx 0.144\%$$

4.  Flush

    A flush consists of five cards of the same suit that are not in
    sequence. The number of ways to choose a suit is $\binom{4}{1} = 4$
    , and the number of ways to choose 5 cards from that suit is
    $\binom{13}{5} = 1287$ . Since this includes straight flushes, we
    subtract 40 (the number of straight flushes):
    $4 \times 1287 - 40 = 5148$. The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Flush}) = \frac{5148}{2598960} \approx 0.198\%$$

5.  Straight

    A straight consists of five consecutive cards of different suits.
    There are 10 possible sequences, and for each sequence, there are
    $4^5 = 1024$ combinations. Subtracting the 40 straight flushes
    gives: $10 \times 1024 - 40 = 10200$. The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Straight}) = \frac{10200}{2598960} \approx 0.392\%$$

6.  Three of a kind

    Three of a kind consists of three cards of the same rank plus two
    unrelated cards. The number of ways to choose the rank for the
    triplet is $\binom{13}{1} = 13$ , and the number of ways to choose 3
    cards of that rank is $\binom{4}{3} = 4$ . The two additional ranks
    are chosen from the remaining 12, with one card selected from each:
    $13 \times 4 \times \binom{12}{2} \times 4^2 = 13 \times 4 \times 66 \times 16 = 54912$.
    The probability is:
    $$P(\text{Three of a Kind}) = \frac{54912}{2598960} \approx 2.11\%$$

7.  Two pairs

    Two pair consists of two cards of one rank, two cards of another
    rank, and one unrelated card. The number of ways to choose 2 ranks
    is $\binom{13}{2} = 78$ , and the number of ways to choose 2 cards
    from each rank is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ . The fifth card is chosen from
    the remaining 44: $78 \times 6^2 \times 44 = 123552$. The
    probability is:
    $$P(\text{Two Pair}) = \frac{123552}{2598960} \approx 4.75\%$$

8.  One pair

    One pair consists of two cards of one rank and three unrelated
    cards. The number of ways to choose the rank for the pair is
    $\binom{13}{1} = 13$ , and the number of ways to choose 2 cards from
    that rank is $\binom{4}{2} = 6$ . The three unrelated ranks are
    chosen from the remaining 12, with one card selected from each:
    $13 \times 6 \times \binom{12}{3} \times 4^3 = 13 \times 6 \times 220 \times 64 = 1098240$.
    The probability is:
    $$P(\text{One Pair}) = \frac{1098240}{2598960} \approx 42.26\%$$

::: {#exm-newton}
(Newton-Pepys problem) The Newton-Pepys problem is a classical
probability problem involving dice rolls, posed in correspondence
between Samuel Pepys, a famous diarist and government official, and
Isaac Newton in 1693. The problem concerns which of the following three
events is most likely when rolling fair dice:

1.  At least one 6 appears when 6 fair dice are rolled.
2.  At least two 6's appear when 12 fair dice are rolled.
3.  At least three 6's appear when 18 fair dice are rolled.
:::

::: solution
We compute the probabilities for each scenario:

1.  Probability of at least one 6 in six rolls of a single die:

    The probability of not rolling a 6 in six rolls is:
    $$P(\text{no 6 in six rolls}) = \frac{5^6}{6^6}$$ Thus, the
    probability of at least one 6 in six rolls is:
    $$P(\text{at least one 6}) = 1 - \frac{5^6}{6^6} \approx 0.67$$

2.  Probability of at least two 6s in twelve rolls of a single die:

    We use the complement, finding the probabilities of getting 0 or 1
    six. The probability of getting exactly 0 sixes in twelve rolls is
    similar as above. The probability of getting exactly 1 six is:
    $$P(1 \text{ six}) = \binom{12}{1} \frac{5^{11}}{6^{12}}$$ Thus, the
    probability of at least two 6s is:
    $$P(\text{at least two 6s}) = 1 - P(0 \text{ six})-P(1 \text{ six}) \approx 0.62$$

3.  Probability of at least three 6s in eighteen rolls of a single die:

    Similarly, we calculate the complement, finding the probabilities of
    getting fewer than 3 sixes. $$\begin{aligned}
    P(\text{at least three 6s}) &= 1 - P(0\text{ six}) -P(1\text{ six}) - P(2\text{ sixes}) \\ \\
    &= 1- \frac{5^{18} + \binom{18}{1}5^{17} + \binom{18}{2} 5^{16}}{6^{18}} \approx 0.60
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Thus,
$P(\text{one 6 in 6 rolls}) > P(\text{two 6s in 12 rolls}) > P(\text{three 6s in 18 rolls})$.

Intuitively, this is because as the number of dice increases, the
likelihood of matching higher thresholds does not keep pace with the
probability of rolling individual sixes. This is perhaps contrary to
most people's common sense: the more dice rolled, the more likely to see
the sixes.
