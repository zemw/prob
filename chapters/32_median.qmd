## Median and mode

The mean is called a measure of *central tendency* because it tells us
something about the center of a distribution, specifically its center of
mass. Other measures of central tendency that are commonly used in
statistics are the median and the mode, which we now define.

## Median

We say that $c$ is a median of a random variable $X$ if
$$P(X\leq c)\geq1/2 \text{ and } P(X\geq c)\geq1/2.$$
:::

Intuitively, the median is a value $c$ such that half the mass of the
distribution falls on either side of $c$ (or as close to half as
possible, for discrete random variables). Note that the condition given
above is more general than $$P(X\leq c)=P(X\geq c)=\frac{1}{2}$$
Consider a discrete distribution as follows: $$P(X=k)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{3},\quad k=1 \\
\frac{1}{2},\quad k=2 \\
\frac{1}{6},\quad k=3
\end{cases}$$ In this case, 2 is a median since
$P(X\leq 2)=5/6 \geq 1/2$ and $P(X\geq 2)=2/3 \geq 1/2$. However,
$P(X\leq 2)\neq P(X\geq 2)$. For strictly continuous random variable
$X$, @def-median does imply $$P(X\leq c)=P(X\geq c)=\frac{1}{2}$$ Since
the CDF of $X$ satisfies $F(c)\geq1/2$ and $1-F(c)\geq 1/2$, which
implies $F(c)=1/2$. Moreover, if the CDF of $X$ is strictly increasing,
$F^{-1}(1/2)$ is the unique median.

::: {#def-mode}
## Mode

For a discrete random variable $X$, we say that $c$ is a mode of $X$ if
it maximizes the PMF: $$P(X=c)\geq P(X=x)\quad\text{ for all }x.$$ For a
continuous random variable $X$ with PDF $f$, we say that $c$ is a mode
if it maximizes the PDF: $$f(c)\geq f(x)\quad\text{ for all }x.$$
:::

Intuitively, the mode is a value that has the greatest mass or density
out of all values in the support of $X$.

::: callout-note
A distribution can have multiple medians and multiple modes. Medians
have to occur side by side; modes can occur all over the distribution.

::: {#exm-incdist}
The main reason why the median is sometimes preferred over the mean is
that the median is more robust to extreme values. A typical example is
the income distribution. Higher incomes are rare, but their absolute
values are high. Thus, the mean income tends be higher than what the
mass of the population would earn. But the median is more robust to
extreme values and is closer to the earnings of an "average" person. For
example, the average monthly income in China is $\yen 2,500$ in 2019,
but the median is only $\yen 1,000$.

::: {#thm-median}
Let $X$ be an random variable with mean $\mu$ , and let $m$ be a median
of $X$.

-   A value of $c$ that minimizes the mean squared error
    $E\left(X-c\right)^{2}$ is $c=\mu$.

-   A value of $c$ that minimizes the mean absolute error
    $E\left|X-c\right|$ is $c=m$.
:::

::: proof
Part 1 - Minimizing the mean squared error $E[(X - c)^2]$. Expand the
mean squared error:
$$E[(X - c)^2] = E[X^2 - 2cX + c^2] = E[X^2] - 2cE[X] + c^2.$$

To find the value of $c$ that minimizes this expression, take the
derivative with respect to $c$ and set it to zero:
$$\frac{d}{dc} E[(X - c)^2] = -2E[X] + 2c=0$$

This implies $c=\mu$. We can confirm with second-order condition that
$c = \mu$ is indeed a minimizer.

Part 2 - Minimizing the mean absolute error $E\left|X-c\right|$.

$$E|X-c|=\int_{-\infty}^{c}(c-x)f(x)dx+\int_c^{\infty}(x-c)f(x)dx$$

Take derivative with respect to $c$, applying the Leibnizâ€™s rule:

$$(c-x)f(x)\frac{d}{dc}c+\int_{-\infty}^c f(x)dx -(x-c)f(x)\frac{d}{dc}c+\int_c^\infty (-f(x))dx=0$$

The first-order condition resolves to
$$\int_{-\infty}^c f(x) dx = \int_c^{\infty}f(x)dx$$ which is exactly
the definition of a median.
