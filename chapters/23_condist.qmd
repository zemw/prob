## Conditional distribution

The conditional PMF of $Y$ given $X=x$ is defined as
$$f_{Y|X} (y|x) = P(Y=y | X=x)=\frac{P(Y=y,X=x)}{P(X=x)}$$ for any $x$
such that $P(X=x)>0$.

### Conditional expectation

The conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X=x$ is defined as
$$\psi(x) = E(Y|X=x)= \sum_{\text{all }y} y\ f_{Y|X}(y|x).$$ $\psi(x)$
depends on the value of $x$ taken by $X$, so it can be thought of as a
function $\psi(X)$ of $X$ itself. $$\psi(X)= E(Y|X)$$ is called the
conditional expectation of $Y$ given $X$.

::: callout-note
Although $E(X)$ is a number, $E(Y|X)$ is a random variable. It is a
function of random variable $X$, and therefore it is a random variable
itself.

Conditional distribution is a key concept in probability, describing how
the distribution of one random variable depends on the values of other
variablesâ€”an idea central to many practical applications. For instance,
we might be interested in how income distributions vary by education
level or how the probability of a disease changes with age.

Conditional expectation gives the expected value of one variable given
the value of another. It is frequently used for making predictions, such
as predicting your earnings given that you graduate from a this college.
