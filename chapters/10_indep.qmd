## Independence

::: {#def-indep}
### Independence for two events
If event $B$'s occurrence does not change the probability of $A$, then
we say $A$ and $B$ are independent. That is to say $A$ and $B$ are
independent if $$P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B).$$ Assuming $P(B)>0$, this is
equivalent to $$P(A|B)=P(A)$$
:::

::: {#thm-indep}
If events $A$ and $B$ are independent, then

-   $A$ and $B^{c}$ are independent;
-   $A^{c}$ and $B^{c}$ are independent.
:::

$A$ and $B$ are independent means they do not provide information to
each other in the sense that conditional probability is not different
from the unconditional probability. It is not an intuitive idea as it
seems. It will become clearer when we discuss random variables in later
chapters.

### Independence for three events
Events $A$, $B$, and $C$ are said to be (mutually) independent if
all of the following equations hold:
$$\begin{aligned}P(A\cap B)= & P(A)P(B),\\
P(A\cap C)= & P(A)P(C),\\
P(B\cap C)= & P(B)P(C),\\
P(A\cap B\cap C)= & P(A)P(B)P(C).
\end{aligned}$$

### Independence for $n$ events
For $n$ events $A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{n}$ to be (mutually)
independent, we require any pair to satisfy
$P(A_{i}\cap A_{j})=P(A_{i})P(A_{j})$ (for $i\neq j$), any triplet to
satisfy $P(A_{i}\cap A_{j}\cap A_{k})=P(A_{i})P(A_{j})P(A_{k})$ (for
$i$, $j$, $k$ distinct), and similarly for all quadruplets, quintuplets,
and so on.

### Don't assume independence without justification

Independence provides lots of nice properties, which are not necessarily
true without independence. A common mistake is to assume independence without
justification. Be careful when you apply properties that assume independence.

## Common confusions {.unnumbered}

::: {.callout-caution}
### Independence is not the same as disjointness.

$A$ and $B$ are disjoint means if $A$ occurs, $B$ cannot occur. But
independence means $A$ occurs has nothing to do with $B$.

### Pairwise independence does not imply independence.

In @def-indep3, If the first three conditions hold, we say that 
$A$, $B$, and $C$ are *pairwise independent*. Pairwise independence does not imply
independence. Convince yourself with the following example.
:::

::: {#exm-1.12}
Consider two fair, independent coin tosses, and let $A$ be the event
that the first is Heads, $B$ the event that the second is Heads, and $C$
the event that both tosses have the same result. Show that $A$, $B$, and
$C$ are pairwise independent but not independent.
:::

::: solution
For each event, $P(A)=\frac{1}{2}$, $P(B)=\frac{1}{2}$. Consider the two
events together, there are four possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT.
$P(C)=P(HH)+P(TT)=\frac{1}{2}$. Thus, $$\begin{aligned}
P(A\cap B) & =P(HH)=\frac{1}{4}=P(A)P(B)\\
P(A\cap C) & =P(HH)=\frac{1}{4}=P(A)P(C)\\
P(B\cap C) & =P(HH)=\frac{1}{4}=P(B)P(C)\end{aligned}$$ But $A,B,C$ are
not independent, because
$$P(A\cap B\cap C)=P(HH)=\frac{1}{4}\neq P(A)P(B)P(C).$$
