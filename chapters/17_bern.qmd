# Bernoulli distribution

We introduce some theoretical distributions from now on. These
distributions are important because they provide standardized models for
common "patterns" of random processes. We develop these distributions
from idealized assumptions. In practice, we usually do not know what is
the "true" distribution of the question of interest. Typically, we "fit"
the question into a theoretical distribution according to their
proximity to the assumptions.

## Bernoulli distribution

A random variable $X$ is said to have the Bernoulli distribution,
denoted as $X\sim Bern(p)$, if $X$ has only two possible values, $0$ and
$1$, and $P(X=1)=p$, $P(X=0)=1-p$.
:::

The PMF of a Bernoulli random variable $X$ is given by
$$P(X=k)=\begin{cases}
p & \textrm{if }k=1,\\
1-p & \textrm{if }k=0.
\end{cases}$$

This can also be expressed as
$$P(X=k)=p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k},\quad k\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} .$$

## Bernoulli trial

A Bernoulli trial is a random experiment with binary outcomes, often
labeled as “success” and “failure,” where the probability of success $p$
remains constant across trials.
:::

Bernoulli trials have numerous applications across various fields. For
instance, in quality control, a product can either pass or fail
inspection; in healthcare, a treatment may either be effective or
ineffective; and in marketing, a consumer may either purchase a product
or not. As long as the probability of success is constant across trials,
we can model such scenarios with Bernoulli distributions.
