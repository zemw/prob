## Monty Hall problem

:::{#exm-monty}
(Monty Hall problem)
Suppose you are on Monty Hall's TV show. There are
three doors. One of them has a car behind it. The other two doors have
goats. Monty knows which one has the car. Monty now asks you to pick one
door. You will win whatever is behind the door. After you pick one door.
Monty opens another door that shows a goat. Monty then asks you if you
want to switch. Is it optimal to switch?

We present two solutions to the problem. The first one is using the law
of total probability. Let $S$: succeed assuming switch; $D_{j}$: door
$j$ has the car, $j\in1,2,3$. Without loss of generality, assume the
initial pick is Door 1. Monty will always open the door with a goat. By
the law of total probability,
$$\begin{aligned}P(S)= & \underbrace{P(S|D_{1})}_{\textrm{switch from initial pick}}P(D_{1})+\underbrace{P(S|D_{2})}_{\textrm{Monty opens door 3}}P(D_{2})+\underbrace{P(S|D_{3})}_{\textrm{Monty opens door 2}}P(D_{3})\\
= & 0+1\times\frac{1}{3}+1\times\frac{1}{3}=\frac{2}{3}.
\end{aligned}$$

The problem can also be solved using the Bayes' rule. Let $D_{j}$: door
$j$ has the car; $M_{j}$: Monty opens door $j$, $j\in1,2,3$. Assume the
initial pick is Door 1. If Monty opens door 3, the probability of
winning the car assuming switching is
$$\begin{aligned}P(D_{2}|M_{3})= & \frac{P(M_{3}|D_{2})P(D_{2})}{P(M_{3})}\\
= & \frac{P(M_{3}|D_{2})P(D_{2})}{P(M_{3}|D_{1})P(D_{1})+P(M_{3}|D_{2})P(D_{2})+P(M_{3}|D_{3})P(D_{3})}\\
= & \frac{1\times\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{3}+1\times\frac{1}{3}+0}=\frac{2}{3}.
\end{aligned}$$

Note that, if door 1 has the car, Monty will open door 2 and 3 with
equal probability, thus $P(M_{3}|D_{1})=\frac{1}{2}$. And Monty will
never open the door with the car, therefore $P(M_{3}|D_{3})=0$.
Similarly, if Monty opens door 2, we have $P(D_{3}|M_{2})=\frac{2}{3}$.
Therefore, the optimal choice is always to switch. Intuitively, because
Monty knows which door has the car, the fact that he always opens the
door without the car gives additional information regarding the choice
of the door.

```{r}

  # three doors numbered 1,2,3
  doors <- c(1,2,3)
  
  # a random door has a car behind it
  car_door <- sample(doors, 1)
  
  # the guest pick a door randomly
  init_pick <- sample(doors, 1)
  
  if (car_door == init_pick) {
    # if the guest pick the car door
    # Monty opens either of the other two doors
    monty_open <- sample(setdiff(doors, car_door), 1)
  } else {
    # otherwise, Monty opens the door without the car
    monty_open <- setdiff(doors, c(car_door, init_pick))
  }
  
  # if the guest switch, he chooses the door other than 
  # his initial choice and the opened door
  switch_door <- setdiff(doors, c(init_pick, monty_open))
  
  # he wins if the switched door is the car door
  win <- switch_door == car_door
  win
}

# repeat the experiment 1000 times and collect the results
wins <- replicate(1000, monty_hall())
# convert the results to numbers: 1-win,0-lose
wins <- as.numeric(wins)
# plot the distribution of values
