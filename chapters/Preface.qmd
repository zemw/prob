# Preface {.unnumbered}

Embarking on the study of probability is both an opportunity and a
challenge. This course represents a critical foundation for all
subsequent studies in econometrics and data science. As we navigate an
era of big data and artificial intelligence, proficiency in probability
theory is indispensable. It not only builds the foundations for higher
level courses but also cultivates a mindset geared towards probabilistic
reasoning, which is essential for mitigating cognitive biases and making
more informed decisions. Human cognition is often not well-equipped to
handle probabilistic thinking. As we will see, human intuition and
heuristics are mostly wrong about probabilistic events. This course
seeks to provide a mathematical framework for properly understanding and
applying probability.

Probability theory is more than just a mathematical discipline; it is a
vital tool for making sense of uncertainty in the real world. Consider
the myriad of questions that we encounter daily: Will it rain tomorrow?
What is the expected return on an investment? What are the odds of a
particular political party winning an election? How can a business
optimize its customer service strategy when customer arrival times are
unpredictable? Probability theory provides a scientific approach to
answering these questions, enabling us to model and analyze
uncertainties with mathematical tools.

However, this journey is not without its difficulties. For freshmen,
particularly those new to calculus and linear algebra, the course
presents a steep learning curve. The breadth of new concepts---such as
random variables, expectations, and various distributions---can be
overwhelming if encountered for the first time. Additionally, the use of
advanced calculus, particularly integrals, may pose challenges for those
who are still familiarizing themselves with these mathematical tools.

Despite these challenges, the rewards of studying probability are
substantial. Gaining a deep understanding of probability will not only
enhance your knowledge base but also fundamentally transform your
approach to problem-solving. The principles you will learn are
applicable to a wide range of fields beyond econometrics and data
science, including engineering, finance, and social sciences. You will
learn the tools to approach these problems systematically and make
informed decisions based on statistical evidence and probability. So be
prepared for a challenging and rewarding journey!

## Learning objectives {.unnumbered}

-   **Review fundamental concepts:** Revisit the probability and
    calculus concepts learned in high school to ensure a solid
    foundation for more advanced topics.
-   **Understand core probability theory:** Gain a thorough
    understanding of key concepts and theorems in probability theory,
    including random variables, expectations, covariances, and so on.
-   **Develop probabilistic thinking:** Learn to approach problems with
    a probabilistic mindset and use random variables to describe and
    analyze uncertain outcomes.
-   **Model real-world events:** Identify and apply important
    probability distributions to model and interpret real-world
    phenomena effectively.
-   **Enjoy and have fun:** Discover and appreciate the inherent
    elegance of mathematics and the beauty of probability theory.

## Study tips {.unnumbered}

-   **Limit electronic distractions:** While digital tools like slides
    and tablets are convenient, traditional paper and pencil methods
    remain the most effective way to engage with and learn mathematics.
    Writing out problems and solutions helps reinforce concepts and
    improve retention.
-   **Focus on key concepts:** College courses are often much more
    intensive than high school classes, and it is not feasible to master
    every detail. Concentrate on understanding the core ideas and
    principles, and don't get overwhelmed by the technical details.
-   **Understand the "why":** In mathematics, understanding the
    underlying reasons and logic behind methods is more important than
    just knowing how to do computations. The "why" helps you grasp the
    broader implications and applications of the techniques you learn.
-   **Gain practical experience:** Although this course emphasizes
    theoretical understanding and does not require programming,
    experimenting with statistical software such as R can be highly
    beneficial. Practical experience with data manipulation and analysis
    will enhance your comprehension and stimulate interest in the
    subject.
-   **Engage with the material:** I will strive to make the course
    engaging and less boring. However, if this course is not your
    primary interest, focus on the aspects of the material that intrigue
    you. Try to have a general impression of the major concepts even
    though you do not remember any detail.
-   **Exams are important, but more important is to enjoy the course.**

This content of this book is organized or follows. We start with
probabilities based on counting, which should be familiar to high school
graduates. Though rudimentary, they often yield surprising results, as
rigorous calculations frequently challenge our intuitions about the
likelihood of events. Special emphasis is placed on conditional
probability, as conditional thinking is crucial both in academic studies
as well as in daily life.

Next, we introduce the core concept of the random variable, which forms
the foundation of all probability distributions and statistical theory.
Random variables are essential tools that allow us to mathematically
model uncertainty. We introduce two types of random variables: discrete
and continuous. We begin with discrete random variables because they do
not require calculus, offering a smoother learning curve for beginners.
Key concepts such as expectations, variance, and covariance are
introduced alongside well-known discrete distributions such as the
Binomial, Geometric, and Poisson distributions. This arrangement ensures
that students can grasp these important concepts without being
overwhelmed by calculus. We also demonstrate how these fundamental
distributions can be applied to solve real-world problems.

Following this, we move on to continuous distributions. We will see that
the formulas from discrete distributions extend naturally to continuous
distributions with the aid of calculus---essentially replacing summation
with integration. We cover some of the most important continuous
distributions, such as the Normal, Exponential, and Gamma distributions,
and explore the interconnections between them. We also extend the
concepts of expectations, variance, and joint distributions to their
continuous forms.

The book concludes with a discussion on sampling and statistical
inference. Since we cannot observe entire distribution, it becomes
necessary to infer distribution properties from finite samples. We
introduce two of the most important theorems in probability and
statistical theory---the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit
Theorem. The breadth and generality of these theorems are remarkable.
But their most significant contribution to statistical applications is
they allow us to gauge how close our sample estimates are to the true
parameter values. The final chapter also includes a brief discussion on
estimator accuracy, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. These
topics are introduced briefly, as they serve primarily to prepare
students for more advanced courses, such as econometrics.

The chapters are organized logically, with each chapter building on the
knowledge presented in the previous ones. Therefore, it is recommended
to follow the sequence of chapters rather than reading them
independently. However, advanced readers who are already familiar with
the topics may feel free to skip between chapters as needed. This
manuscript is written tersely, serving as a skeleton to complement
lecture materials. It is not intended as a substitute for lectures or
comprehensive textbooks. Students who wish to learn the course material
solely by reading are encouraged to consult a formal textbook.

This manuscript is a preliminary version, and while efforts have been
made to ensure accuracy, errors may still be present. Your feedback on
any mistakes or inaccuracies is greatly appreciated and will help
improve the material.
