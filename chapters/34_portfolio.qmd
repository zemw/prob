# Portfolio allocation\*

In the world of finance, one of the most well-established principles is
the idea of **diversification**. By combining assets with varying levels
of risk and return, investors can reduce the overall risk of their
portfolio. One of the most powerful tools for achieving this is
**correlation**, a statistical measure that quantifies how two assets
move in relation to each other. Understanding and applying the concept
of correlation can be the key to constructing portfolios that not only
aim for higher returns but also minimize risk. This section demonstrates
how a lower correlation between assets can significantly reduce
portfolio risk while maintaining the same expected return.

**The Role of Correlation in Portfolio Risk**

A core principle in portfolio management is that the overall portfolio
risk (or volatility) is not simply the weighted average of the
individual asset risks. Instead, it also depends on how the assets in
the portfolio are correlated with each other. When assets have lower
correlation, the overall risk of the portfolio is reduced. This occurs
because the assets will not all move in the same direction at the same
time, thus smoothing out large fluctuations in the portfolio value.

To quantify this relationship, we use a formula that calculates the
portfolio risk:

$$\sigma_P =
\sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}}$$

Where: $\sigma_P$ is the overall portfolio risk. $w_A$ and $w_B$ are the
weights of the assets in the portfolio. $\sigma_A$ and $\sigma_B$ are
the individual standard deviations (risks) of assets A and B.
$\rho_{AB}$ is the correlation between the two assets.

Consider a portfolio of two assets, Asset A and Asset B. Both assets
have the same expected return of 10% and individual risks (standard
deviations) of 15%. The key difference between the two cases is the
correlation between the assets.

Case 1: High Correlation

Let’s assume that the correlation between the two assets is 0.8,
indicating that the two assets tend to move in the same direction. In
this scenario, we will calculate the portfolio risk when we allocate 50%
of the portfolio to Asset A and 50% to Asset B.

$$\sigma_P =
\sqrt{(0.5)^2 (0.15)^2 + (0.5)^2 (0.15)^2 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.15)(0.15)(0.8)}\approx 20.12\%$$

Case 2: Low Correlation

Now, let’s assume that the correlation between the two assets is 0.2,
indicating a much weaker relationship between the two assets. Again, we
allocate 50% to Asset A and 50% to Asset B. Using the same formula, we
can compute the portfolio risk:

$$\sigma_P =
\sqrt{(0.5)^2 (0.15)^2 + (0.5)^2 (0.15)^2 + 2(0.5)(0.5)(0.15)(0.15)(0.2)} \approx 16.1\%$$

In this example, by reducing the correlation between the two assets, we
reduced the portfolio risk by approximately 4%, even though the expected
return remained the same (since the return of both assets was
identical).

**The principle of diversification**

Diversification is often referred to as a “free lunch” in finance
because it allows investors to reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing
expected returns. The reason lower correlation reduces risk is that when
assets are highly correlated, they tend to move together, amplifying the
portfolio’s overall volatility. In contrast, when assets are less
correlated, they do not move in lockstep, and the portfolio experiences
less overall volatility because the negative fluctuations of one asset
can be offset by the positive fluctuations of the other. This is a key
advantage of diversification: it allows you to spread risk across assets
that behave differently.
