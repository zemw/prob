In the world of finance, one of the most well-established principles is the idea of **diversification**. By combining assets with varying levels of risk and return, investors can reduce the overall risk of their portfolio.

Consider a portfolio of two assets, Asset A and Asset B. Both assets have the same expected return and individual risks (standard deviations), and they are weighted equally in the portfolio.

| Asset | Return $\mu$  | Risk $\sigma$  | Weight $w$  |
|-------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **A** | 10%           | 15%            | 50%         |
| **B** | 10%           | 15%            | 50%         |

The expected return of the portfolio is: $$\mu_P=w_A\mu_A + w_B\mu_B = 10\%$$ Let's consider the portfolio risk. First, assuming high correlation, $\rho_{AB}^H=0.8$. The portfolio risk is: $$\sigma_P^{H} =
\sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}^H}\approx 14.2\%$$

If assuming low correlation, $\rho_{AB}^L=0.2$. The portfolio risk is: $$\sigma_P^{L} =
\sqrt{w_A^2 \sigma_A^2 + w_B^2 \sigma_B^2 + 2w_A w_B \sigma_A \sigma_B \rho_{AB}^L}\approx 11.6\%$$

As we see, by reducing the correlation between the two assets, we reduced the portfolio risk, though the expected return remains the same.
Therefore, diversification is often referred to as a “free lunch” in finance because it allows investors to reduce portfolio risk without sacrificing expected returns.
