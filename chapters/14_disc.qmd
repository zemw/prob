## Discrete RVs

::: {#def-disrv}
## Discrete random variable

We say $X$ is a discrete random variable if $X$ can take a finite or
countable number of values $x_1,x_2, \ldots,x_n$.

::: {#def-supp}
## Support

The finite or countably infinite set of values $x$ such that $P(X=x)>0$
is called the support of $X$.

::: {#def-pmf}
## Probability mass function

If a random variable $X$ has a discrete distribution, the probability
mass function (PMF) of $X$ is defined as the function $f$ such that
$$f(x)=P(X=x).$$

### Notation for PMF

PMF is also known as the **probability function**, since $f(x)$ gives
the probability. Throughout this lecture notes, we use PMF for
abbreviation. But you will find the textbook uses *p.f.* They are
different conventions for the same thing.

Note that how $f(x)$ differs from the probability function $P(\cdot)$.
$f(x)$ is a real-valued function, whereas $P(\cdot)$ is the probability
operator. Also note that $x$ is not the same as random variable $X$.
Sometimes, we add a subscript, $f_{X}(x)$, to specify this is the PMF
for random variable $X$.

Because we also use $f(x)$ to denote the PDF for continuous random
variables. PDF is known as the density function, it is not probability.
So we better avoid confusing the two. To distinguish a PMF from a PDF,
we may use $p(x)$ for PMF and $f(x)$ for PDF. Mostly in this lecture
note, we simply use $P(X=k)$ for PMF.

::: {#prp-pmf}
A valid PMF must satisfy the following criteria:

-   Non-negative: $P(X=k)\geq0$ for all $k$;
-   Sum up to one: $\sum_{k}P(X=k)=1$.
:::

There are different ways to represent a PMF. We can (1) list all the
possible values and their associated probabilities; (2) write a formula
for the PMF; or (3) visualize it in a graph.

::: {#exm-drv-1}
A random variable $X$ is said to have the **Bernoulli distribution** if
$X$ has only two possible values, $0$ and $1$, and $P(X=1)=p$,
$P(X=0)=1-p$. The PMF of $X$ is $$P(X=k)=p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k}$$ where
$k\in\left\{ 0,1\right\}$.
