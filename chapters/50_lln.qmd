## Law of large numbers

We now introduce two important theorems describing the behavior of the
sample mean as the sample size grows. Throughout this section and the
next, we assume $X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{n}$ are i.i.d RVs drawn from a
population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$. The sample mean is
defined as

$$\bar{X}_{n}=\frac{X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}}{n}.$$

As we have discussed previously, the sample mean is itself a random
variable with mean and variance:

$$\begin{aligned}
E(\bar{X}_{n}) & =\frac{1}{n}E(X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n})=\frac{1}{n}(E(X_{1})+\cdots+E(X_{n}))=\mu,\\
Var(\bar{X}_{n}) & =\frac{1}{n^{2}}Var(X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n})\overset{iid}{=}\frac{1}{n^{2}}(Var(X_{1})+\cdots+Var(X_{n}))=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}.\end{aligned}$$

The law of large numbers (LLN) says that as n grows, the sample mean
$\bar{X}_{n}$ converges to the true mean $\mu$.

::: {#thm-7.1}
(Strong law of large numbers). The sample mean $\bar{X}_{n}$ converges
to the true mean $\mu$ point-wise as $n\to\infty$, with probability $1$.
In other words, the event $\bar{X}_{n}\to\mu$ has probability $1$.
:::

::: {#thm-7.2}
(Weak law of large numbers). For all $\epsilon>0$,
$P(|\bar{X}_{n}-\mu|>\epsilon)\to0$ as $n\to\infty$. (this is known as
converge in probability).
:::

We don't need a rigorous proof here. But an intuitive proof is obvious.
As $n\to\infty$, $Var(\bar{X}_{n})=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{n}\to0$. The random
variable $\bar{X}_{n}$ becomes fixed at $\mu$ as $n$ becomes large.
Thus, it converges to $\mu$ in a probabilistic sense.

It seems that the LLN just states the obvious. But it has wide
applications in daily time that you might not even realize. What it says
is essentially this: the uncertainty at the individual level becomes
certain when aggregating together; the risks that are unmanageable at
the individual level becomes manageable collectively. Think about a rare
disease, it happens at 1 out of a million probability. For each
individual, no one knows if they will get the disease or not. But as the
sample size gets large, suppose we have one billion population, the LLN
says the sample mean will be very close the true mean. That is, there
will be almost surely 1000 people being infected by the disease. We
provide two more examples.

::: {#exm-7.1}
(Lottery). A lottery company is designing a game with a 6-digit format.
Each time someone buys a ticket, they receive a randomly generated
6-digit number. Only one number will win the grand prize of 10 million
dollars. What should the company charge per ticket to break even?
:::

::: solution
The probability of winning the game is $p=1/10^{6}$. Suppose the company
has sold $n$ tickets. The price for each ticket is $x$. The revenue for
the company is therefore $xn$. By the LLN, the cost of the company
should be very close to $10^{7}np$. The break even point is
$xn=10^{7}np$. So $x=10^{7}p=10$. Therefore, if the company sells each
ticket above 10 dollars. The business is surely profitable as long as
$n$ is large. If the company is a monopoly, it can reap as much profit
as it desires as long as they know the basic probability theory! The
same can be said about gambling companies.
:::

::: {#exm-7.2}
(Insurance). Insurance is anther great application of the LLN. It is
essentially the same as the the lottery game but most people do not
realize it. Suppose there is a disease with infection rate of 1 out of 1
million. The medical expenditure to cure the disease is 10 million
dollars. How much the insurance company should charge per customer to
cover this disease?
:::

::: solution
The solution is essentially the same as above. Suppose the premium for
the insurance product is $x$. The revenue of the company by selling the
premium is $xn$. The cost is --- when one customer is infected, the
company has to pay the medical cost ---$10^{7}np$. The break even price
for the insurance premium is thus $10$ dollars.

What is the implication of this insurance? Without the insurance, each
individual either chooses to set aside 10 million dollars pre-cautiously
for the disease (if he is rich enough) or be exposed to the risk
completely uncovered. The insurance product enables everyone to get
covered at a cost of just 10 dollars. It is a typical example that the
unmanageable risk at the individual level becomes manageable
collectively.
