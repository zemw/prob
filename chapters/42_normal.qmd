## Normal distribution

The most widely used model for random variables with continuous
distributions is the family of normal distributions. One reason is that
many real world samples appears to be normally distributed (the mass
centered around the mean). The other reason is because of the Central
Limit Theorem (will be discussed in later chapters), which essentially
says the sum (or mean) or any random samples are approximately normal.

::: {#def-std-normal}
A random variable $Z$ has the standard Normal distribution with mean $0$
and variance $1$, denoted as $Z\sim N(0,1)$, if $Z$ has a PDF that
follows $$f(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^{2}/2}.$$
:::

This is a valid PDF because $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(z)dz=1$, which
directly follows from @exm-gauss. We further verify its mean and
variance:

$$E(Z)=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}z\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^{2}/2}dz=0\quad\textrm{by symmetry.}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
Var(Z) & =E(Z^{2})-(EZ)^{2}=E(Z^{2})\\
 & =\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}z^{2}\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-z^{2}/2}dz\\
 & =\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\underbrace{z}_{u}\cdot\underbrace{ze^{-z^{2}/2}dz}_{dv}\\
 & =\frac{2}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\left\{ \left[z(-e^{-z^{2}/2})\right]_{0}^{\infty}+\underbrace{\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-z^{2}/2}dz}_{\sqrt{2\pi}/2}\right\} \\
 & =1.\end{aligned}$$

::: {#def-phi}
The CDF of standard normal distribution is usually denoted by $\Phi$.
Therefore,
$$\Phi(z)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^{z}e^{-t^{2}/2}dt.$$ By
symmetry, we have $\Phi(-z)=1-\Phi(z)$.
:::

::: {#def-normal}
Let $X=\mu+\sigma Z$ where $Z\sim N(0,1)$. Then we say $X$ has the
Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$, denoted
as $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$. The PDF of $X$ is given by
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right].$$
:::

The mean and variance of $X$ can be easily verified by the properties of
expectation and variance. $$\begin{aligned}
E(X) & =E(\mu+\sigma Z)=\mu+\sigma E(Z)=\mu,\\
Var(X) & =Var(\mu+\sigma Z)=\sigma^{2}Var(Z)=\sigma^{2}.\end{aligned}$$

To verify the PDF, we utilize the standard normal CDF:
$$P(X\leq x)=P\left(\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}\leq\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)=\Phi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)$$

The PDF is the derivative of the CDF,
$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma}\Phi'\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left[-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}\right].$$

The shape of the normal distribution is the famous bell-shaped curve.

## Three-sigma rule
The normal distribution has the "three-sigma rule": $$\begin{aligned}
P(|X-\mu|\leq\sigma) & \approx0.68\\
P(|X-\mu|\leq2\sigma) & \approx0.95\\
P(|X-\mu|\leq3\sigma) & \approx0.997\end{aligned}$$ Critical values:
$\Phi(-1)\approx0.16,\Phi(-2)\approx0.025,\Phi(-3)\approx0.0015$.
:::

::: {#thm-normal-1}
Let $X$ have the Normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance
$\sigma^{2}$. Let $F$ be the CDF of $X$. Then the **standardization** of
$X$ $$Z=\frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$$ has the standard normal distribution,
and, for all $x$: $$F(x)=\Phi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right).$$
:::

To find the value of $\Phi(z)$, we need to use the normal probability
table or statistical software.

::: {#exm-5.3}
Suppose the test score of a class of 50 students is normally distributed
with mean 80 and standard deviation 20 (the total mark is 100). A
student has scored 90. What is his percentile in the class?
:::

::: solution
$X\sim N(80,20)$. We want to find $P(X<90)$. Standardize the
distribution:
$$P(X<90)=P\left(\frac{X-80}{20}<\frac{90-80}{20}\right)=\Phi(0.5)\approx0.69.$$

```{r}
# Exam scores from past students
scores <- read.csv("../dataset/exam.csv")$final

# Histogram of the exam scores
hist(scores, prob = TRUE, col = "lightblue")

# Overlay the normal curve
curve(dnorm(x, mean(scores), sd(scores)), col = "red", lwd = 2, add = TRUE)
```


::: {#thm-normal-2}
Suppose $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^{2})$. If $Y=aX+b$, then $Y$ has the Normal
distribution $Y\sim N(a\mu+b,a^{2}\sigma^{2})$.
:::

::: {#thm-normal-3}
If the random variables $X_{1},\ldots,X_{k}$ are independent and
$X_{i}\sim N(\mu_{i},\sigma_{i}^{2})$. Then
$$X_{1}+\cdots+X_{k}\sim N(\mu_{1}+\cdots+\mu_{k},\sigma_{1}^{2}+\cdots+\sigma_{k}^{2}).$$

::: {#exm-5.4}
Suppose the heights (in centimeters) of women and men independently
follow the normal distribution, $X\sim N(165,25)$, $Y\sim N(170,25)$.
Determine the probability that a randomly selected woman will be taller
than a man.
:::

::: solution
Let $W=Y-X\sim N(170-165,25+25).$ Then $W\sim N(5,50)$. Therefore,
$$P(W<0)=P\left(\frac{W-5}{\sqrt{50}}<\frac{-5}{\sqrt{50}}\right)=P\left(Z<-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)=\Phi(-0.707)\approx0.24.$$
