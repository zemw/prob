## Exponential distribution

Imagine you are a shop owner that waits for your next customer. The
customers arrive randomly. What interests us is the waiting time 
until the next customer arrives. 

Let $X$ represent the waiting time. 
Since the customers arrives randomly, the likelihood of it
coming in the next moment is the same whether you've been waiting for
one minute or ten minutes. 
In other words, the probability of waiting another $t$ minutes is the same 
no matter how long you've already waited. Therefore,
$$P(X\geq s+t\mid X\geq s)=P(X\geq t),\quad\forall s,t\geq0.$$
The conditional probability can be rewritten using the definition of
conditional probabilities:
$$P(X\geq s+t\mid X\geq s)=\frac{P(X\geq s+t)}{P(X\geq s)}.$$ Thus, the
memoryless property implies:
$$\frac{P(X\geq s+t)}{P(X\geq s)}=P(X\geq t).$$ Let the survival
function $S(x)$ represent $P(X\geq x)$ . Substituting $S(x)$ into the
equation gives: $$\frac{S(s+t)}{S(s)}=S(t).$$ This reminds us of the
exponential function. In fact, the only continuous and non-negative
solution to this equation is: $$S(x)=e^{-\lambda x},\quad\lambda>0,$$
where $\lambda$ is a positive constant. This solution represents the
probability that the waiting time exceeds $x$ , and $\lambda$ determines
how quickly the probability decreases over time.

The CDF of $X$ is exactly the opposite of $S(x)$:
$$F(x)=1-S(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}.$$ Take derivative to get the PDF:
$$f(x)=F'(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x}.$$

### Exponential distribution

A random variable $X$ is said to have the Exponential distribution with
parameter $\lambda$ if its PDF is
$$f(x)=\lambda e^{-\lambda x},\qquad x>0.$$

We denote this as $X\sim\textrm{Exp}(\lambda).$$\lambda$ is interpreted
as the "rate", i.e. number of events per unit of time.
:::

To compute the expectation and variance, we first standardize the
exponential distribution. Let $Y=\lambda X$, then
$Y\sim\textrm{Exp}(1)$, because
$$P(Y\leq y)=P(X\leq y/\lambda)=1-e^{-y}.$$ It follows that,
$$\begin{aligned}
E(Y) & =\int_{0}^{\infty}ye^{-y}dy=\left[-ye^{-y}\right]_{0}^{\infty}+\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-y}dy=1;\\
Var(Y) & =E(Y^{2})-(EY)^{2}=\int_{0}^{\infty}y^{2}e^{-y}dy-1=1.\end{aligned}$$
For $X=Y/\lambda$, we have $E(X)=\frac{1}{\lambda}$,
$Var(X)=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}$.

### Memoryless property
If $X$ has the exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$, and
let $t>0$, $h>0$, then $$P(X\geq t+h|X\geq t)=P(X\geq h).$$
:::

::: proof
For $t>0$ we have
$$P(X\geq t)=\int_{t}^{\infty}\lambda e^{-\lambda x}dx=e^{-\lambda t}.$$
Hence for each $t>0$ and each $h>0$,
$$P(X\geq t+h|X\geq t)=\frac{P(X\geq t+h)}{P(X\geq t)}=\frac{e^{-\lambda(t+h)}}{e^{-\lambda t}}=e^{-\lambda h}=P(X\geq h).$$ 
:::

The memoryless property is a very special property of the Exponential
distribution. In fact, the Exponential is the only memoryless continuous
distribution (with support $(0,\infty)$); and Geometric distribution is
the only memoryless discrete distribution (with support $0,1,\dots$).

### Poisson-Exponential connection
Let $T$ be the time between two consecutive events in Poisson process
$\text{Pois}(\lambda t)$. Then $T$ follows Exponential distribution
$T\sim\text{Exp}(\lambda)$.
:::

::: proof
The waiting time $T>t$ is equivalent to no event occurred during period
$t$. Therefore,
$$P(T>t)=P(N_{t}=0)=e^{-\lambda t}\frac{(\lambda t)^{0}}{0!}=e^{-\lambda t}$$
where $N_{t}$ is the number of events occurred in $[0,t]$, which follows
a Poisson distribution. The CDF of $T$ is

$$F(t)=1-P(T>t)=1-e^{-\lambda t}$$

The PDF of $T$ is $$f(t)=F'(t)=\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$$ This indicates
$T\sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$.

### Bus arrivals
We try to model the waiting time at a bus station. Suppose the bus
arrives at random time but on average there will be one bus per 10
minutes. You arrive at the bus stop at a random time, not knowing how
long ago the previous bus came. What is the distribution of your waiting
time for the next bus? What is the mean waiting time? What is the median
waiting time?
:::

::: solution
The bus arrivals in a period of time is best modeled by a Poisson distribution. 
Let $X$ be the waiting time and we know it is an Exponential
distribution. Since $E(X)=1/\lambda=10$, $X\sim\textrm{Exp}(1/10)$. 
Thus, The average waiting time is always 10 minutes.

The CDF of $X$ is $F(x)=1-e^{-\lambda x}$. The median $m$ satisfies
$F(m) = 1/2$. Thus, $m= \log(2)/\lambda \approx 6.9$ minutes. So the
typical waiting experienced by most passengers is less than 10 minutes.
