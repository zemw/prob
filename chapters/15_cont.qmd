## Continuous random variable

We say a random variable $X$ has a continuous random variable if the
possible values of $X$ takes the form of a continuum.

## Probability density function

For a continuous random variable $X$, the probability density function
(PDF) of $X$ is a real-valued function $f$ such that
$$P(a\leq X\leq b)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx.$$

Continuous random variables are usually measurements. Examples include
height, weight, temperature, the amount of money and so on.

## Density is not probability

PDF differs from the discrete PMF in important ways:

-   For a continuous random variable, $P(X=x)=0$ for all $x$;
-   The quantity $f(x)$ is not a probability. To get the probability, we
    integrate the PDF (probability is the area under the PDF):
    $$P(a<X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx.$$
-   Since any single value has probability 0, including or excluding
    endpoints does not matter.
    $$P(a<X<b)=P(a<X\leq b)=P(a\leq X<b)=P(a\leq X\leq b).$$

The PDF $f$ of a continuous random variable must satisfy the following
criteria:

-   Non-negative: $f(x)\geq0$;
-   Integrate to one: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=1$.

A **uniform distribution** is a probability distribution where all
values within a specified interval $[a, b]$ are equally likely to occur,
and its probability density function (PDF) is given by:
$$f(x) = \frac{1}{b - a} \quad \text{for} \quad a \leq x \leq b$$ and
$f(x) = 0$ otherwise.

## Don't confuse a random variable with its distribution

If random variable $X$ has distribution $f(x)$, the distribution of
$X^2$ is not $f^2(x)$. To get the distribution of $X+Y$, you can't just
add up $f_X(x)+f_Y(y)$. The right way to do it will be discussed in
later chapters (transformation and convolution).

Every morning, a student waits for the elevator in their dormitory. The
waiting time (in minutes) is equally likely to be anywhere between 0 and
3 minutes, depending on when the elevator arrives.

1.  Define the random variable $X$ = "the studentâ€™s elevator waiting
    time." What is the support of $X$?
2.  Derive the probability density function (PDF) of $X$.
3.  Compute $P(X \leq 1)$, i.e. the probability that the waiting time is
    at most 1 minute.
4.  If the student must wait more than 2 minutes, they decide to take
    the stairs instead. Define a new indicator random variable
    $Y = \mathbb{I}(X>2)$. Compute $P(Y=1)$.
