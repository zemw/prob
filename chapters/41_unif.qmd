## Uniform distribution

::: {#def-unif-1}
Let $a$ and $b$ be two given real numbers such that $a<b$. Let $X$ be a
random variable such that it is known that $a\leq X\leq b$ and, for
every subinterval of $[a,b]$, the probability that $X$ will belong to
that subinterval is proportional to the length of that subinterval. We
then say that the random variable $X$ has the Uniform distribution on
the interval $[a,b]$. The PDF of $X$ is $$f(x)=\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{b-a} & \textrm{for }a\leq x\leq b\\
0 & \textrm{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$
:::

This is a valid PDF since
$$\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(x)dx=\int_{a}^{b}\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}dx=1.$$

The CDF of $X$ is

$$F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(t)dt=\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt=\begin{cases}
0 & x<a\\
\frac{x-a}{b-a} & a\leq x\leq b\\
1 & x>b
\end{cases}.$$

The expectation of $X$:

$$E(X)=\int_{a}^{b}x\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\frac{1}{b-a}\left[\frac{x^{2}}{2}\right]_{a}^{b}=\frac{a+b}{2}.$$

To figure out the variance, first compute

$$E(X^{2})=\int_{a}^{b}x^{2}\frac{1}{b-a}dx=\frac{1}{b-a}\left[\frac{x^{3}}{3}\right]_{a}^{b}=\frac{a^{2}+ab+b^{2}}{3}$$

Thus,

$$Var(X)=E(X^{2})-E^{2}(X)=\frac{a^{2}+ab+b^{2}}{3}-\frac{(a+b)^{2}}{4}=\frac{(b-a)^{2}}{12}.$$

::: {#exm-5.1}
A stick of unit length is broken at a random point X. What is the
expected length of the longer piece?
:::

::: solution
The lengths of the two pieces are $X$ and $1-X$, with $X\sim Unif(0,1)$.
The longer piece is $\max(X,1-X)$. For $X<0.5$, the longer piece is
$1-X$, and for $X\geq0.5$, it is $X$. The expected value is:
$$E[\max(X,1-X)]=\int_{0}^{0.5}(1-X)\,dx+\int_{0.5}^{1}X\,dx=\frac{3}{4}.$$
:::

Intuition might suggest that since the stick is broken at a random
point, the longer piece should be "somewhat larger" than the shorter
piece, but not as large as 3/4. However, the uniform distribution of the
break point means that the longer piece can sometimes be much larger
than the shorter piece, especially when the break point is close to one
end.

# Simulate breaking the stick
X <- runif(n_simulations, min = 0, max = 1)  # Random break points
longer_piece <- pmax(X, 1 - X)  # Length of the longer piece

# Compute the expected length
expected_length <- mean(longer_piece)

# Print the result
