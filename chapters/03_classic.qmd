## Classical probability

::: {#def-classical}
Classical (naive) definition of probability:
$$P(A)=\frac{\left|A\right|}{\left|S\right|}=\dfrac{\textrm{number of outcomes favorable to A}}{\textrm{total number of outcomes in A}}$$
assuming the outcomes are [finite]{.underline} and [equally
likely]{.underline}.

## Don't misuse the classical definition

The classical probability is very restrictive. It only applies to
scenarios such as flipping coins or rolling dice where the outcomes are
equally likely. It has often been misapplied by people who assume
equally likely outcomes without justification. For example, if one wants
calculate the probability of a rainy day, it would be misleading to
assume every day is equally likely to rain and compute
$\frac{\text{rainy days}}{365}$.

Calculating the naive probability of an event $A$ often involves
counting the number of outcomes in $A$ and the number of outcomes in the
sample space $S$, which usually involve some counting methods. We now
review some of the counting methods (multiplications, factorials,
permutations, combinations) that was introduced in high schools.

## Counting methods {.unnumbered}

**Multiplications.** Consider a compound experiment consisting of two
sub-experiments, Experiment A and Experiment B. Suppose that Experiment
A has $a$ possible outcomes, and for each of those outcomes Experiment B
has $b$ possible outcomes. Then the compound experiment has $a\times b$
possible outcomes.

**Exponentiation.** Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from
them, one at a time [with replacement]{.underline}. Then there are
$n^{k}$ possible outcomes.

**Factorials.** Consider $n$ objects $1,2,\dots,n$. A permutation of
$1,2,\dots,n$ is an arrangement of them in some order, e.g., $3,5,1,2,4$
is a permutation of $1,2,3,4,5$. The are $n!$ permutations of
$1,2,\dots,n$.

**Permutations**. Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them,
one at a time [without replacement]{.underline}. Then there are
$P_{n}^{k}=n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)=\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$ possible outcomes, for $k\leq n$.
(Ordering matters in this case, e.g. $1,2,3$ is considered different
from $2,3,1$)

**Combinations**. Consider $n$ objects and making $k$ choices from them,
one at a time without replacement, without distinguishing between the
different orders in which they could be chosen (e.g. $1,2,3$ is
considered no different from $2,3,1$). Then there are
$C_{n}^{k}=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!}$ possible outcomes. In modern
math, we prefer the notation $$\binom{n}{k}\equiv C_n^k,$$ which reads as "$n$
choose $k$".

The following table summarizes the counting methods.

|                  | order matters | order doesn't matter |
|------------------|:-------------:|:--------------------:|
| with replacement |    $n^{k}$    |   $\binom{n+k-1}{k}$    |
| non-replacement  |  $\frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$  |     $\binom{n}{k}$      |

The upper-right corner case is equivalent to putting $k$
indistinguishable balls into $n$ distinguishable baskets (e.g. two balls
in Basket 3 means the 3rd object is chosen twice). Therefore, the number
of possible arrangements is $\binom{k+n-1}{n-1}$.

## Binomial coefficient {.unnumbered}

The Binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ counts the number of subsets of
size $k$ for a set of size $n$. It is also the coefficient of $x^k$ when
expanding the polynomial $(x+y)^n$.

::: {#thm-binom}
## Binomial theorem

$$(x+y)^{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}x^{k}y^{n-k}.$$

The coefficients form an infinite triangle called the **Pascal
triangle**. By observing the patterns in the triangle, it is not hard to
conclude the following recursive formula:

$$\binom{n}{k} = \binom{n-1}{k-1} + \binom{n-1}{k}$$

The value of the binomial coefficient is only defined for non-negative
integers $n$ and $k$ with $0 \leq k \leq n$. But mathematics is about
**generalization**. We can generalize the notion of "$n$ choose $k$" for
negative $n$: $$\begin{aligned}
\binom{-n}{k} &= \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{-n-i}{k-i}
=(-1)^k \prod_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{n+i}{k-i} \\
&=(-1)^k\frac{n(n+1)\dots(n+k-1)}{k!}\\
&=(-1)^k\frac{(n+k-1)!}{k!(n-1)!}\\
&=(-1)^k\binom{n+k-1}{k}
\end{aligned}$$

We can also extend the formula to real numbers and even complex numbers:

$$\binom{x}{y}=\frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(y+1)\Gamma(x-y+1)}$$where
$\Gamma(x+1)=x!$ is a generalization of factorials. We will come back to
the Gamma function when we discuss Gamma distributions.
