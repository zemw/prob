## Continuous vs Discrete

Continuous random variables, in many ways, are more versatile and useful
than discrete distributions. One key reason is that many quantities in
the physical world, such as temperature, height, weight, and time, are
inherently continuous in nature. These variables can take on any value
within a range, providing a more accurate representation of real-world
phenomena compared to discrete variables, which are limited to distinct
values. Additionally, the probability density functions (PDFs) of
continuous distributions are often defined by smooth, differentiable
functions. This mathematical structure allows us to apply calculus for
analysis, enabling precise calculations of probabilities, expected
values, and other statistical measures. The ability to integrate and
differentiate these functions not only simplifies manipulation but also
makes continuous distributions a powerful tool for solving complex
problems in physics, engineering, and data analysis.

::: {#def-crv-1}
A random variable has a continuous distribution if its CDF is
*differentiable*. A continuous random variable is a random variable with
a continuous distribution.
:::

::: {#def-pdf-1}
For a continuous random variable $X$ with CDF $F$, the probability
density function (PDF) of $X$ is the derivative of the CDF, given by
$f(x)=F'(x)$. The support of $X$ is the set of all $x$ where $f(x)>0$.
:::

::: remark
By the fundamental theorem of calculus, we integrate a PDF to get the
CDF: $$F(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{x}f(t)dt.$$ PDF differs from the discrete
PMF in important ways:

-   For a continuous random variable, $P(X=x)=0$ for all $x$;
-   The quantity $f(x)$ is not a probability. To get the probability, we
    integrate the PDF (probability is the area under the PDF):
    $$P(a<X\leq b)=F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx.$$
-   Since any single value has probability 0, including or excluding
    endpoints does not matter.
    $$P(a<X<b)=P(a<X\leq b)=P(a\leq X<b)=P(a\leq X\leq b).$$
:::

::: {#thm-crv-pdf}
The PDF $f$ of a continuous random variable must satisfy the following
criteria:

-   Nonnegative: $f(x)\geq0$;
-   Integrates to 1: $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)dx=1$.
:::

::: {#def-crv-exp}
The expectation of a continuous random variable $X$ with PDF $f$ is
$$E(X)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xf(x)dx.$$
:::

::: {#thm-crv-lotus}
If $X$ is a continuous random variable with PDF $f$ and
$g:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$. The LOTUS applies
$$E[g(X)]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}g(x)f(x)dx.$$
