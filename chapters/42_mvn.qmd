## Bivariate normal distribution

$(X,Y)$ is said to have a Bivariate Normal distribution if the joint PDF
satisfies
$$f(x,y)=\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2(1-\rho^{2})}(x^{2}+y^{2}-2\rho xy)\right)$$
where $\rho\in(-1,1)$ is the correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

**Multivariate Normal (MVN)** is an extension of the bivariate normal
distribution to $n$-dimensional variables. We skip the joint PDF here
since it is too complicated. But like the bivariate case, an MVN is
fully specified by knowing the mean of each component, the variance of
each component, and the covariance between any two components.

## Marginal normality does not imply joint normality

If $(X_{1},...,X_{k})$ is MVN, then the marginal distribution of every
$X_{j}$ is Normal. However, the converse is false: it is possible to
have Normally distributed $X_{1},...,X_{k}$ such that
$(X_{1},...,X_{k})$ is not Multivariate Normal.

::: {#thm-mvn}
A random vector $(X_{1},...,X_{k})$ is Multivariate Normal if every
linear combination of the $X_{j}$ has a Normal distribution ($X_{j}$ do
not have to be independent). That is, we require
$t_{1}X_{1}+\cdot\cdot\cdot+t_{k}X_{k}$ to have a Normal distribution
for any choice of constants $t_{1},...,t_{k}$.

::: {#thm-mvn-corr}
In general, uncorrelated does not imply independent. But with an MVN
random vector, uncorrelated implies independent. In particular, if
$(X,Y)$ is Bivariate Normal and $\rho_{XY}=0$, then X and Y are
independent.

::: {#thm-mvn-condexp}
If $(X,Y)$ is Bivariate Normal, then the conditional expectation
satisfies $$E(Y|X)=E(Y)+\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)}(X-E(X)).$$

In other words, $$E(Y|X)=a+bX$$where $b=\frac{Cov(X,Y)}{Var(X)}$ and
$a=E(Y)-bE(X)$.
:::

This is exactly the case in @def-lm, where we assume the conditional
expectation $E(Y|X)$ is a linear function of $X$. This assumption is
true when $(X,Y)$ are jointly normal. Otherwise, the assumption might
not be reasonable. In practice, we don't know precisely the joint
distribution of variables. The linear model is just a simplified
assumption.
