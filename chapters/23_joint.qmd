# Bivariate distribution

We need a tool to study collections of variables. Knowledge of each
individual PMF is of little help. Because variables can be dependent on
each each other (they are not necessarily independent). We need to know
their inter-relationship. Joint distribution gives the probability that
two or more random variables simultaneously takes particular values.

## Joint distribution

The joint PMF of random variables $(X,Y)$ is given by
$$f(x,y) = P(X=x,Y=y).$$

The joint CDF of random variables $(X,Y)$ is given by
$$F(x,y) = P(X\leq x,Y\leq y).$$
:::

::: {#thm-drv-indep}
The discrete random variables $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if and
only if $$P(X=x,Y=y)=P(X=x)P(Y=y)$$ for all possible values of $x,y$.

Equivalently, the condition can be stated with CDF: the random variables
$X$ and $Y$ are **independent** if and only if
$$P(X\leq x,Y\leq y)=P(X\leq x)P(Y\leq y)$$ for all possible values of
$x,y$.
:::

::: proof
$X$ and $Y$ are independent implies the event $\{X=x\}$ and $\{Y=y\}$
are independent for any $x,y$. By @def-indep, we have
$$P(X=x,Y=y)= P(\{X=x\}\cap\{Y=y\})=P(X=x)P(Y=y).$$
:::

::: callout-note
If $X$ and $Y$ are independent, then any function of $X$ is independent
of any function of $Y$.

::: {#def-marg-pmf}
## Marginal distribution

The marginal distribution gives the distribution of a subset of
variables in a joint distribution without reference to the values of the
other variables.

The marginal PMF of $X$ given the joint PMF of $(X,Y)$ is given by
$$f_X(x) = \sum_y P(X=x,Y=y)=\sum_y f_{X,Y}(x,y).$$
:::

::: callout-note
It is easy to compute the marginal distribution given the joint
distribution. However, in general, we cannot deduce the joint
distribution from the marginal distribution. Unless the random variables
are independent, the joint distribution is **not** the product of
marginal distributions.

::: {#exm-marg-pmf-1}
Let $X$ be an indicator of an individual being a current smoker. Let $Y$
be the indicator of his developing lung cancer at some point in his
life. The joint PMF of $X$ and $Y$ is as specified in the table below.

|           |          |          |           |
|-----------|:--------:|:--------:|:---------:|
|           |  $Y=1$   |  $Y=0$   | **Total** |
| $X=1$     |   0.05   |   0.20   | **0.25**  |
| $X=0$     |   0.03   |   0.72   | **0.75**  |
| **Total** | **0.08** | **0.92** |   **1**   |

The marginal PMF for having lung cancer is

$$\begin{aligned}P(Y=1)= & P(Y=1,X=0)+P(Y=1,X=1)=0.08,\\
P(Y=0)= & P(Y=0,X=0)+P(Y=0,X=1)=0.92.
\end{aligned}$$

In this example, $X,Y$ are not independent, because
$$P(X=1,Y=1)\neq P(X=1)P(Y=1).$$
:::

::: {#def-iid}
If a given number of random variables are independent and have the same
distribution, we call them **independent and identically distributed**,
or **i.i.d** for short.
:::

-   Independent and identically distributed ($X,Y$ independent die
    rolls)
-   Independent and not identically distributed ($X$: die roll; $Y$:
    coin flip)
-   Dependent and identically distributed ($X$: number of Heads; $Y$:
    number of Tails)
-   Dependent and not identically distributed ($X$: economic growth;
    $Y$: presidential election)

::: callout-note
We view random sample as a collection of i.i.d random variables from the
same population distribution. For example, let $X_i$ be the test score
of student $i$. We say $X_1,X_2,\dots,X_n \overset{iid}{\sim} G$ where
$G$ is the (unknown) population distribution for test scores.

The **independent** assumption means that one observation does not
influence another, while the **identically** **distributed** assumption
ensures all observations follow the same probability law. This
perspective simplifies statistical analysis and is foundational for many
statistical inference.

### Benford's law
The distribution of first two digits in many real-life data 
(e.g. annual accounts of a corporation) can be approximated 
by the joint mass function:
$$f(x,y) = \log_{10}\left(1+\frac{1}{10x+y}\right),\quad 1\leq x\leq 9,0\leq y\leq 9.$$

1. Verify this is valid joint PMF.
2. Find the marginal PMF of $X$. 
3. Give an approximation to $E(X)$.
