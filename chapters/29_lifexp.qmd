## Life expectancy

Life expectancy is the average number of years a person is expected to
live. It is a crucial indicator of the quality of living and one of the
three components of the Human Development Index (HDI) (the other two
components are education and per capita GDP). Here is a toy example to
compute life expectancy with hypothetical data.[^exp-1]

To simplify our analysis, we will assume there are only five possible
ages: 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80. A baby is born at age 0, and can either die
at that age or survive to age 20. We intentionally exclude intermediate
ages such as 5 and 10 for the sake of computational simplicity.

It's important to note that life expectancy is [not]{.underline} the
same as the average age of the population. For instance, based on the
hypothetical data presented, the average age can be calculated as:
$$\overline{\textrm{Age}}=(0\times200+20\times300+40\times250+60\times150+80\times100)/1000=33.$$

However, the expected age, denoted as $E(\textrm{Age})$, is defined as:
$$E(\textrm{Age})=\sum\textrm{Age}\times P(\textrm{Age}).$$

To compute this expected value, we need to determine $P(\textrm{Age})$,
the probability of living to a specific age or dying at that age. This
requires consideration of the mortality rate at each age, which is given
in Column 3.

Assuming 1000 babies are born at age 0, with a mortality rate of 1% at
that age, we find that 99% of the babies survive to age 20. Thus, the
number of babies that survive to age 20 is: $1000\times(1-1\%)=990$. We
can apply similar calculations to determine the number of survivors at
each subsequent age.

The number of individuals who die at a specific age (Column 5) is the
difference between the number of survivors at that age and the next
(Column 4). To find the probability of living to a specific age, we
compute: $P(\textrm{Age})=\textrm{Column 4}/1000$.

Finally, we compute the expected value of age (or life expectancy) as
follows:
$$E(Age)=0\times1\%+20\times2\%+40\times10\%+60\times17\%+80\times70\%=70.6.$$
This figure differs from the average age. Since the mortality rate is
low at younger ages, the probabilities $P(\textrm{Age})$ for these ages
are also low, while they are higher for older ages. This example
illustrates the distinction between average and expected values. In
everyday conversation, we may use these terms interchangeably, but in
certain contexts, expected values can significantly differ from
averages.

    clarify the definition of expectation. See [this tutorial from
